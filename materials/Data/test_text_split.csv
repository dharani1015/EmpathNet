602,female,1,13,1,67.0,602,"this is super need I like this  me either at all can you do it at home  wow  okay  alrighty  yes I am  hopefully fine thanks for asking  I'm originally from California born and raised and I live in Carson at the moment  all of the beaches the sun in the amusement parks  the traffic LA traffic is hectic  not really  I read and I listen to soft music like jazz or something  I don't like people to walk in front of me don't excuse me cut me off in traffic when I'm driving I don't like a Tailgater little small small, small remarks that people make them upset me I just don't want to be I'm Easily Aggravated so I don't have to be aggravated  I'm pretty good at controlling it sometimes but at times I can get very irate so I'm working on that right now  do I have an argument almost a year but when I did it was over a girl that was my ex boyfriend it was over female but it's over now so I haven't had any real argument since almost a year  I studied in college I did a child of element and I also study computer science  right now I'm a homemaker I don't work at all I haven't been working in about 3 months now was laid off but I was doing receptionist work so I'm currently looking for employment at this moment  my dream job is all my own design Graphics computer shop which means I'm when you do your you grab your designs online and you send them to different distributors and what they do is they approve or they approve or disapprove what you put they like or dislike about the design so they went ahead with it they'll buy them for me and then they'll go from there  I don't know I used to in the past but not at the moment  when I was with my daughter my mom it was very delightful we stay from was 2 weeks and it was not even two years ago it was very very nice and I wish I can go back to the beaches for beautiful the food is great the blue owls are great at night it was really really nice a great experience  very close to my mother and my daughter were all three were like sisters we can be any closer  my parents my grandparents who have now gone there if they're past but they were a very positive influence in my life my guy friend that I'm dating now he's very positive in my life so  I have a lot of backbone support you can say  I don't right now because I'm living with my mother step dad I'm trying to move someplace on my own now but it's kind of hard not working at all so I just have to wing it out so I can do better  no it's just myself my daughter my mom and my stepdad at the moment  no I haven't  yes I have  almost 2 years now  no I had no idea  just always feeling down and out cleaning myself in not want to be bothered with other the outside world just a little mood swings and just can't sleep at night all all kind of little stuff that kind of got me feeling like something wasn't right about me  yes I do  yes I do it's very useful  it is very much so  reason why I feel like it's helping me is because the lady NYC there the therapy place she's very nice she she's willing to help out in any way she can she's almost to be like a psychiatrist she's very good I mean she talked to me about things encourage me to what not to do what you do to help calm down to feel better and she's very nice or all-in-all I always leave their confidence all the time  number one of my mood swings I've noticed a big change in that and my attitude  affected me in a great way I would never say negative because I like like I said it goes back to the helpfulness after scene from The Lady and I'm a therapist and  the different ways I was coached on how to improve my lifestyle to avoid the problem that I do have right now or suffer with so that's how it affected me that way  the attitudes and mood swings can't sleep at night depressed all the time no outside company at all didn't want to be bothered with anybody friends or family locked up in my room all the time halfway not wanting to eat or overeating it was just a lot  maybe like any little thing would trigger me off like somebody say something wrong to me that I would think was wrong it would just figured I would just get triggered and just snapped for no reason it's just I don't know what would cause it besides that  well now I'm doing I'm coping with it by not snapping his medicine just trying to stay calm and I just need a lot of positive environment around me not negativity that helps to so with that being said I just kind of maintain and keep my high self-esteem up is As much as I can  a lot better than before  yes I have very positive thoughts very positive behavior much better than what it was very big improvement from before  yes I have been for the past few months I've been feeling a little better  I have at times but today no I'm feeling pretty upbeat  it's not very easy but I try but for the past few nights I have a sleepy the full night so that's a positive for me  very cranky very groggy Moody  actually  yesterday that we see something was up over the phone and I was happy the whole day I'm still kind of happy about a tattoo so that was very good for me  my best friend is a male he would probably surprise me as upbeat always ready to go  luv2eat  just a fun person to be around  no I don't got anything  thank you for having me  bye  love it"

609,male,0,0,0,19.0,609,research experience  actually going to see a virtual human here for a second  got it  but I told Claudia was going to send her an email or having I'm bringing the  mawamba Children's Choir from Uganda to the VA grounds on August 3rd to open to the public lots of good food and entertainment we're honoring World War 2 veterans so I'm going to send it to her for everyone it's there's no charge and if you want to get a preview go onto YouTube and look at mawamba mwamba mawamba children there may I saw them a month ago and I said I got to find a way the first time ever on the west coast they've been in the United States on east coast once before and they are 20 of them from 9 to 14 Summer from an orphanage summer have their families and to just the energy if it is totally a man blew me away I watch 400 people's jumping to their feet cheering as I have to bring that to the veterans so they're coming they'll be at the Seventh Day Adventist Church sometime middle of July they'll be at the veterans home where I am  the 18th of July and then they'll be out on the Great Lawn on August 3rd so it'll be the August 3rd event and crate they're bringing a trailer ring in BBQ for everybody and it's going to be a wonderful time we have anything will send it in or you're more than happy and I okay at night I don't think I do but I met you sent me an email and I noticed you have the military would have to understand it from West Point okay and they would I mean that we're going to have generals were going to be on during World War two people they might love to come oh yeah  and when she in when Claudius in scene  sure  should probably be more interesting than some people at Smokin pit  okay  will do it  can you turn up the volume just a bit  can you turn up the volume just a bit  find thank you  where are you from originally Boston Massachusetts  things you really like about a leg  people first and foremost I'm very involved with the veteran community and I'm a chaplain answering my 52nd year  things you don't really like  traffic but that's true anywhere  I see what you mean  do you experience do you experience virtual traffic  what do you enjoy about traveling  the experience is the food the culture travel to 44 countries in my career  I'd like to hear that one of your trips  I was stationed in Paris France  and travel to France Spain Morocco live in Germany is part of my chaplaincy service it was unbelievably exciting  visiting SEC liqueur in that my Mart in Paris on my first day in France in Europe  I graduated with a degree in Psychology from Boston College  what do you do now I'm retired but I'm still very active as a volunteer at the prison in Chino women's prison and I can deck services at  Jewish community that I stablished 51 + years ago  what's your dream job  actually I've been living my dream job since I was 17 years old serving in the chaplain city as a Jewish chaplain is what I wanted to do from the time I was early five or six years old I want to become a rabbi  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing quite outgoing  why because I'm able to be dropped into a room of 500 or a thousand total strangers and get to know them and have them get to know me without discomfort  I'm divorced I was married for 16 years I have a daughter  my she's been there at the light of my life my entire life I have a brother and sister-in-law and living back in Boston my parents are deceased  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  I actually have a fish tank and aquarium and instead of turning it on and seeing Virtual Fish shine watch the real thing  I also like to go fishing deep-sea fishing  I'm able to do that quite well  when was the last time you argue with someone  I would say it was a several months ago and it was about language  dating someone and I thought her language was inappropriate and at first I thought I would say nothing and then I decided I should tell her what I was thinking and so I did  that you wish you would handle differently  the last time I saw my former wife she has created some legal problems for me and  I was not as polite as I might have been  I felt she was totally wrong and out of line it's been a very difficult and acrimonious divorce took 13 years to resolve  that I in the last few years have not spent as much time with my daughter I was quite ill and ended up having open heart surgery and that was time when really she was abandoned I was always there to be buffer between my former wife and my daughter and when I was suddenly taken ill took me about two years to really become healthy again and during those two years she had to fend for herself from the ages of 15 to 17 difficult time for a daughter to be on her own with the mother who  not as as nurturing as one would like  that was the hardest decision ironically was going to do I have the surgery now and try to save my life knowing that I would be abandoning my daughter abandoning in the Lesser sense of the word we were still in contact but I couldn't be there to run interference for her or put it off and maybe suffered the consequences so I I made the decision to have the surgery  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  the only real negatives in my life have been in connection with the divorce I never thought I would be divorced I always wanted to be married and have four children and the white picket fence now I got married and I had a child and had the white picket fence actually built it  but that was the toughest thing for me  adjusting to divorce I never thought it would have I nobody in my family on either side has ever been divorced  yes I was in the air force during Vietnam War  how old were you when you join the military  17 I was going to go to Hebrew Union college-jewish Seminary in Cincinnati Ohio the war was raging in Vietnam and there was a need for chaplains and I was asked if I would serve and so I did and I originally thought it would be two years and then it was three and it was a four and then they had more time shows for years and two months I don't regret a day of it  unfortunately I served in Europe not in Vietnam I was never shot at I never had to kill anybody but I really enjoyed my military service  why'd you decide to enlist in the military  why do they say to do what  why do they say to go in  yes going into the military was an opportunity for me to travel the world and do what I love doing and I've continued doing it for the rest of my adult life  did you ever see combat never not a day  but it was the luck of the draw when you put on the uniform you go where the government send you I could have just as easily been shipped off to Vietnam about 55 of the 60 people with who like trained went to Vietnam and fewer than 50 returned  very high mortality  I'm sorry to hear that  how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life  very easy because of the type of service I had it was as close to Miller cech's civilian life is one cat have  started a business ran the business and while I continued as a volunteer chaplain and I've been doing that I still do it to this day  alright I'm 68  it didn't change me as much as it allowed me I guess it did change me at a lot of Peter broaden my horizons here I was coming from Boston basically a kid and I find myself traveling the world and in a very responsible position conducting religious services and teaching and working with other chaplains of other faiths a lot of interfaith work in the military  marvelous experience I don't know anyone else who's ever done it quite the way I've done it  I hold the record in Europe for on Passover we had 16 Passover seder is in 8 days in five countries  why are you sorry  how you been feeling lately Dracut  tell me more about that  I got a feeling good I've been very fortunate since having open heart surgery I've been relatively healthy and I'm very involved in the community and I enjoy every every aspect of that sometimes it's very tiring but it's a good tired  have you noticed any changes in her behavior or softly I don't understand have I ever done what  how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep very easy I usually retire about 11:30 12:00 at night and sleep through for 6 to 7 hours  and it's usually as a result of being ill if I have the flu or cold or whatever then I'm sluggish the next day or for two days but I'm usually able to bounce back  no I've not fortunately  I've never been diagnosed with PTSD  I've never been diagnosed with PTSD  you're asking me questions that I've already answered that I've not been diagnosed with PTSD so they're not triggered since they don't exist  can you tell me about that  I just did  turn of the frustrations of dealing with it a virtual person is your pre-program just so you're not asking the right question  tell me more about that  what is your next question  you feel therapy is useful I think it is for some people yes probably for most  tell me more about that  I think it's a very useful tool and many people have been successful in receiving therapy  many of the veterans with whom I live in work I have had extensive therapy and it's proven to be very successful  changes have you noticed  I haven't been going to therapy so there haven't been changes  all right  when was the last time you felt really happy  yesterday  went to a birthday party there somebody 85 years old and there was a great great granddaughter who were just celebrating her first birthday  it was a fun day  yes it was  old number of people  a number of rabbis and people in the clergy generally  all of them 20 or 30 40 years older than I and that's I was growing up they were my mentors  how your best friend describe you  active  vibrant dynamic  I always having a full plate  follow through if I start something I finish it and if I make it commitment I honor it  tell me about something you did recently that you really enjoyed  I'm connected Services a week ago Friday night and then this past Friday conducted services at my own community  we had a wonderful musical time both times  yes it was you would have enjoyed it  we didn't have any virtual people but it was nice  my daughter and the accomplishments I've had in my career  my daughter has gone on to graduate  and is currently employed managing a fund at City she'll be 27 on Saturday  okay  you're welcome  goodbye  okay  couple of comments
615,male,0,3,0,22.0,615,I'm going to have you alert me to look up  sure sure the algorithm  still see her for a second I'll shrink your back download  another thing to mention is that  church so I won't ask questions  sure  no problem  so I just answer the questions  ChaCha  okay  sure  okay  yeah I'm ready I'm cool  good nice day no traffic to get here  so you have no complaints  the East Coast  well the weather is fairly consistent I like the surfing probably the most I like about it allies the surfing the beach surf can't do that anywhere else  traffic flaky people  you're a different culture than the East Coast education's more valued back East so what I don't like is probably the personality is people here in traffic  not currently but I have traveled a lot in the past but currently not really traveling  changes the environment seeing different yo meeting different people that different cultures obviously depending where I'm traveling from traveling to Orange County it's not an entirely different deal in here but I mean like your upper would have would have you just different cultures different environments seeing different things  but obviously you couldn't see from sitting at home in your couch  David I've been to Europe many times in 2003 I went to Europe for several months just traveling around and I went to places I've never been before like Scandinavia and parts of Eastern Europe and I was interesting cuz I'd never know the typical Spain Italy London France trip I've done a million times but I've never been to Scandinavia which is a little bit different than Western Europe and obviously Eastern Europe is very different to  oh gosh many of them  that's a tough question cuz I've had many good experiences traveling on  okay not that particular trip but running with the bulls in Pamplona Spain that's very memorable which is actually going on right now as we speak  history and political science  trade basically so yeah wholesale trade if you will so buying selling  so I guess you could say distribution  equipment my main job that is my main job so I guess it's Logistics you can call it so basically the logistics of moving goods from point A to point B Freight forwarding you could call it  many different variants of it  I'm outgoing  because I am not shy I can talk to any stranger in a room on the street I'm not really afraid of people that I'm I'm not nervous or afraid so I'm comfortable talking to strangers  not that I'm going up to every person on the street and having a conversation but if I'm at a party I don't know anybody I can strike up a conversation very easily  it's good. But I'm the only one out here my family lives on the east coast and in abroad so but with technology it's easy to communicate with the email Facebook Skype so even though distance wise  separated it's pretty much easy and free to stay in communication  I know it's not  whatever like to yeah I just to relax and avoid stress I go surfing big stress reliever  I go surfing and it's pretty intense pain can be dangerous and that relaxes me  cuz what I'm in the water and when I forgot whenever I was stressed out about  enough looking it up screensavers going to do it for me I got to do something physical  I'm going to control my temper I'm I'm a very controlled person so  I'm not  you know for real for my buttons to get pushed they really have to get pushed so I don't even have a temperature control so  it's not even an issue  oh probably politics  are you over politics  you know the current administration his opinion versus my opinion  oh  there's probably met a situation handled differently I don't know  that would probably be something related to relationship personal relationships  Damien  I feel guilty about  push-up guilty about  probably having wasted you know  I feel guilty what I waste time  what I accomplished nothing and I waste time that makes me feel bad  soccer question  hardest decision I've ever had to make probably breaking up with a girl  that breaking up with a guy with a girl  yes  22 23 22 23  I wanted the  action the excitement there is a war a conflict going on and it seemed like the right thing to do with the time and  it seemed  like that was more of an important thing to do then yes it in a job working  are you happy  yes I would do it over again  a little  it was easy I mean the transition was easy after I made a transition by going to graduate school after the military to ease into that transition and that was a that probably made it easier than going right for the military right to civilian life so I had a transitional phase for several years  started working  go after the military I'm sorry after the military went to graduate school and then I started working  I wouldn't say it change me because it probably just fine-tuned whatever I had I was an officer and so you can't let go in and you're not going in when you're 18 you're going in after college so you got to have a little bit of discipline to go in and especially the branch that I went in so it didn't radically change me it just basically you know fine tune me  you couldn't go in if I maybe if I wanted 18 it would have been something different but it did just fine tune me  no there's nothing to be sorry about  fun  but I've been feeling fine I give you stress just looking anything but I intend to have a good way of managing stress  cuz I guess I'm used to the stress so I can guide have learned to manage it well  Troy study changes in my behavior enough  love you hey I'm pretty consistent so like my behavior is radically changed  music for you to get a good night sleep  that  that's hit-or-miss sometimes  it's easy and other times extremely difficult so I'm Hit or Miss. I wouldn't say it's always easy for me to get a good night's sleep but  hit or miss so it's like every night I can't go to sleep but I  if I work out enough and surf enough I'm tired enough that I just sleep regardless so I guess it would say it's moderately easy for me to get a good night sleep  if I exhaust myself appropriately  otherwise I'll have too much energy too much on my mind that I'm able to go to sleep if I  worked out enough surf for 4 hours 3 hours literally I'll be so exhausted that I have no doubt I'll fall asleep on the couch so  if I don't I'll have a lot of energy and I'll get antsy and I have a lot of thoughts going through my head when I'm laying down at night. It'll be hard to go to sleep because too much stuff is racing through my head  so what I got to do what I didn't do what I need to do  I don't sleep well I just I'm probably I wouldn't say I'm like you're the bull I'm not an irritable person but I just feel like crap so I'm probably not as happy when I don't sleep well  can I get a good night sleep and my body feels like crap if I don't get a good night sleep  you tend to eat at me personally I tend you eat worse when I don't get a good night sleep  I don't feel as good  physically  no  felt really happy  plus I felt really happy  but I got an answer the question probably don't know about a month ago I when I caught a really good big wave I felt really happy when I cut this big wave  surfing of course it is absolutely  yeah I'm never upset or pissed off when I'm surfing I'm very happy when I'm surfing if I catch a big way very happy  funny extroverted a lot of energy  oh yesterday I can say surfing again but I'll keep repeating myself yesterday I went to Hollywood do a independent bookstore where they had a book reading and I was kind of cool  oh yeah  like my achievements that I was in the military  Maya  physical abilities I'm very proud of so I've worked hard to be able to  yo I do what I can do surfing and other things I'm a very good athlete I'm proud that I'm a very good athlete cuz I worked hard to be a good athlete  yeah. I guess I'm proud that I'm an intelligent person to not just whatever born with an innate intelligence but fairly well-educated that and I worked hard for that so I'm proud that I'm an intelligent person  cuz it was some work involved yet to get to get there  sure anytime

I'll come back and I just want to make sure she doesn't  okay  okay  okay alrighty  yes  I'm doing well  I'm a born and raised in Los Angeles California  I love the weather the diversity of the people that are here and just a sense of Entrepreneurship that you can accomplish anything if you're from LA  the smog and pollution it definitely it is extremely congested and maybe too much of the Hollywood persona  not as much as I'd like to but I have traveled a bit  sing something new I would like to see everything that my eyes can explore so experiencing new cultures and new environments  okay the last trip that I can think of that I went on was to North Carolina which is somewhere that I lived before I went back to visit for a weekend and it was kind of like a party welcome home back time and then I came back to LA  having my children I was I would probably be the most memorable experiences I've had I had both of my children natural childbirth without any medication so quite memorable  in high school I was in a music Magnum I was a dancer and I sang a bit but primarily dance and in college my major is business with entrepreneurial I don't know I've stopped in college right now but I want to pursue business  what do you do now  primarily stay at home with my newborn baby while she's not a newborn she's 9 months now and I just work part-time mostly from home  my dream job would definitely incorporate helping people on some type of platform may be working for a non-profit but where I could really juggle and balance being at home taking care of my family and incorporating that with providing a service that provides income  I consider myself pretty outgoing  I make direct eye contact I'm not afraid to engage in conversation with people I enjoy meeting new people and conversation so I think that just really being willing to actually go out and talk and Explorer makes me all going  I have my mother I was raised with and my sister will 10 years younger than me those remind me dear family and my own family as I have a 12 year old son a 9 month old daughter and my boyfriend is my current family that I live with and I'm very close to my family  I do like to read sometimes it definitely listen to music same thing just try to get my mind away I enjoy all types of music or sometimes I play games on my computer or just playing with my kids  needs Improvement for sure I think that I displayed too much email emotion be a good or bad so I was have a little bit of a temper  the last time I argue with someone was over the weekend and it was with my boyfriend and it was really about contemplating breaking up and moving away from each other  in most arguments when I reflect back the main thing that I wish I would handle differently is not losing my cool controlling my temper I wish that even In the Heat of the Moment that this is the temperament and type of communication that I use  I guess making what I feel like our bad decisions not being able to provide enough for my children or not feeling like I am where I'm capable of being a should be at this point in life  I feel guilty about not making the right financial and career choices at this point in life so far  I also feel  the hardest decision I ever had to make was  whether to go to a memorial for my aunt or to work that I guess in retrospect wasn't including but really it was a decision for me on business or family and I chose family and it's made me  really really be more aware of my family and not let a corporation or a job control me  I would say  an event or space or something I could have raised for my memory would be a 911 the whole experience of 9/11 and I wish I could erase it for the entire country  yes  I was 19 years old when I'm in the military  I got being born and raised in Los Angeles I kind of feel that a very free spirit and I'd say maybe hippie personality and when I graduated from high school I just felt that I wasn't reaching my potential and thought I could help myself by trying to establish some discipline I thought that was something that the military put off for me and it did  I am happy that I did that that I served my country and that I actually enlisted  yes kind of I was in Saudi Arabia when 9/11 happen and ended up serving as  support for the air portion of the war was being it's his was being it happened it was happening from Saudi Arabia  not very easy I think that was a very very hard time or scary time to be away from my family my son was only 12 months when I left 13 months when I left at the time it was very hard to adjust to get back to establishing trust with him again and just from being gone for 4 months it was difficult to readjust with such a big thing that had affected our entire country and in the entire world  after the military I started working for the restaurant industry I became a restaurant manager and eventually a training manager and ran I'm training for a restaurant for for the house and back of house employees all aspects of the restaurant  I think it made me a lot more  aggressive I don't know if that's the best word to use may be confident I'm very aware of eye contact paying attention to detail and timeliness things of that nature I'd say the positive factors of the military are being very disciplined and again paying attention to detail  lately I've been pretty hard on myself I haven't been working much just taking care of the baby and I'm really really trying to figure out which direction I went next in life howling forward  I don't feel like I have been as positive as I used to be  I feel like I need a lot more encouragement I feel like I'm a lot more needy and clingy Than I Used to Be however at the same time I've been isolating myself a whole lot more than I usually do  it depends on what's happening with my daughter if my baby is awake I'm awake when she sleeps I sleep  tired of probably a little cranky as well  you know I've been talking to a therapist for about the past 3 months I have not had a full psychological evaluation but she definitely said I was just playing fine of PTSD depression and anxiety  yes same therapist again says that she feels that I'm experiencing signs and showing signs of depression  definitely what I had my baby 9 months ago really happy lately I can't think of an exact time or experience  my grandmother has been a very positive influence in my life my mother have expended a lot of strong women I look up to have been very powerful influences on my life  my best friend would probably describe me as a free spirit  very loving loyal  and a  I don't know maybe I'm predictable  well on the 4th of July I took my baby out to the park and just played with bubbles I know that's a little but that really makes me happy spend time with my kids and just being in the moment and being still and feel like I have no needs to be met just enjoying my time with my children  I am most proud of Taking Chances even though I think I'm hard on myself sometimes I think I've been very courageous I joined the military young Ace I left my family I moved to different parts of the country by myself I most proud of myself for Taking Chances  goodbye  okay
620,male,0,0,0,17.0,620,oh okay  okay  so I'll be looking at that image  your field of psychology  okay  and you are at USC  Lincoln City  oh okay my cousin went Upstate but Cornell he has a beautiful waterfalls blah blah blah  yeah  he was he was the lawyer for the deposed Governor Patterson of New York  yeah  never have them please  she got her hair done all that gets  why doesn't she face me more  she's at an angle which is okay but I'm just going to just observe  yeah the cavalry  this internet radio show  I've been doing it for 6 weeks and the technology failed us every time except the last time  thanks  looks the same to me  oh got it I said  sure  Bergen Record  are you running three or four rooms at the same time  yeah  yeah  yeps  it's a good today  I'm a native of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania  shellac of snow  the weather is good  and it's a more open  free liberal place  I am extremely happy to be in La I'm extremely happy to be not on the East Coast so I'm going to say that I have no complaints  I pretty much live in a village and my Village is a couple square miles and  I meet all my needs close by  I travel by bicycle and I enjoy the fitness that I drive  I have the same trip everyday jump on the bike by Sunset Strip roll to my downhill to the farmer's market for lunch tell three more miles uphill to the post office and shopping and roll down Sunset back home again  well they're all pretty good  I used to attend the Little League World Series and that was a memorable experience  English lit  I have involved in politics and writing and I just launched an internet radio show  it might be reasonable to say that I have that dream job right now in terms of I'm fully immersed in the media and I have an outlet  I'm a pretty perfect combination of both but I'm not going as a public persona  well it is necessary to be out going to communicate to persuade to function in society and to entertain and to have Lively up friendships  I'm the oldest of nine we're in pretty good shape I talk to my brother John each week my sister Mary each week my sister Patty each week my sister Dolores every couple weeks so what we're in pretty good shape  Isaiah  watch MSNBC I watched all of them any of the political shows  I read I'm on the internet  but I would say that I'm okay if controlling my temper I I don't have fights and I've never had any trouble with the law so perhaps I'm doing something right  that was a non sequitur  oh I had a minor disagreement with my brother last night just about  the Dynamics of the radio show and the concept of a permanent co-host versus rotating guest hosts and we each look at it differently and I really didn't fight with him I let him have his opinion  nothing really leaps to mind I am old enough that I  by and large learn to how to cope  not being president of the United States  well that's the hardest decision I ever made was the easiest decision I ever made which was leaving the confines of the East Coast traveling 3000 Miles without family or friends because it was important to do for to fulfill myself  you know it's hard to respond to that because even negative images and experiences I learn from you know I'm going to be philosophical and say I'm happy for  all my experiences and I'm happy for all my scars  yes  I was 21 when I joined the military  it was not much of a decision that was essentially a forced on me and others we had a draft at that time  I am now  did I see combat we were rocketed and I was never a med Evac hospital I've seen  combat images I've seen  mangled people coming in off the helicopters  don't know I went back to civilian life I worked a job and went to school and function  I came home to Pennsylvania finished my college and and then moved to California  I didn't quite hear that one how did the military treat me fairly and I got to the benefit of the GI bill for my education and I currently have the medical benefit of the VA so I suppose the deal worked out favorably for each of us  a pretty good optimistic fit  I'm getting more done being more productive and more fulfilled lately  I sleep no problemo  I sleep just fine no problem  when I typically do sleep well if I don't get enough sleep it impacts my day of course  no I have not been I have not  I have not been diagnosed with depression  I felt really happy on Sunday having achieved a radio program and I got on the internet and shared it with my friends  let us say  people who impacted by my youth  gave me my first job and radio and up to with a wonderful thing  you might have to ask him I think people find me pretty upbeat cheerful enthusiastic they certainly would say smart  yesterday I had a wonderful  10 mile bike ride in the Heat and I'm happy that I'm physically able to do that  that I have survived the most proud that I've survived all manner of dangers  and I have endured I have persevered I'll even be bold enough to say that I have a Triumph  it's been a joy  goodbye

623,male,0,9,0,26.0,623,I'm doing it on but I'm not  oh okay  smartphone app turn it off  sorry about that  I've been on the other end somewhere else around here I did a study  it was it was fine it was good  okay  great  okay  oh okay if she stopped talking to like 10 to 15 seconds  okay great  yes  I'm doing fine thank you  Macon Georgia  yeah I'm from Macon Georgia  I like the city  I sometime like the fast-paced of it I like the weather the beaches and I like the opportunities that you have here versus  any other cities that I've been that I lived in so loved the weather is nice city to live in  traffic traffic and  the property here is very expensive  pretty spread out city is hard to kind of get two things if you don't have a car that makes it hard and the mass the transportation here is not as good so are those are just a few things that I I don't like about la  not as not as much as I like to  what I enjoy about traveling is boarding a plane and going somewhere that you possibly never been before I like the idea of where you going you may experience new things meet new people and just a overall fact of getting out of your environment  sort of the Rat Race as I call it  one of my trips is been such a long long time ago I went to your particular I flew into Belgium that was a great experience and I went to visit my brother that stayed in Belgium Brussels and I was over there for two weeks I got to visit I actually drove from Belgium  to Germany  and drove from Berlin Germany to Paris France so the experience was great  the people is great  The Nightlife was good. Enjoy the time of Europe I really liked it  could you repeat that again  why didn't further my education in college but I did finish high school and some of the subject that I liked and I was in high school was I love American history  and I enjoyed science stairs with some to a my top subjects when I was in high school  what do you do now  and now I work in real estate I work for a guy in real estate and I find property's or properties that has been abandoned by their owners or whoever that live there and if we can find the people we we we offered them a contract on the property then once they agree to that everybody signs off on it and then we start to go in and rehabitat the place fix it up clean it up and turn around and sell it at all and I put up Advertising Signs for the business also so I'm evolve a little bit into real estate  I don't know if I have a dream job but  my success would lie on  being financially secure which I find  real estate can bring that once I start to achieve it so I guess my dream job would be to  how my own slower properties throughout California and possibly throughout some other states in our country and just doing very well in real estate  outgoing  because I'm I'm more open to people of different cultures I love to talk  I love to engage in intellectual conversations I like to debate I'm not sure I'm very open to any Topic in the subject that anyone want to speak about or speak on  so I consider myself very outgoing  my relationship with my family is very good my dad is deceased  I've about  maybe 11 12 years now my mother is still alive she's live back in Georgia. Believe she's 75 years old now for social switch still resides in Georgia or brother that lives in outside Detroit  so that makes up my family I contact them on a weekly basis via email or text  or phone call or very close very close Southern family and I love them very much just don't get to see them as much as I like to  I'm what I do to relax is to connect with on some close friends also I found out if I  going to work out or  do my thing is sort of really stressed I like to work out so a lot of times I go and take the dog for a walk or I'll watch a nice comedy on television so that's sort of how I get to  relieve the stress in my life  I'm very easy I'm I'm very hard to get upset so it's nothing to control their but when I do feel like there is a temple coming on I sort of think about something else to do or  just Don allowed to control me  always think of something positive to do when I feel like my temper is starting to escalate  when was the  the last time I argue with someone was some  just last night my girlfriend where it was an argument but she felt like I wasn't giving her enough attention and I felt like I was giving her a lot of attention so neither one of us was willing to give an inch that's that's a trademark of aquarius so we sort of Argyll way to sleep  not a big argument but we just couldn't agree on what we wanted to get across to one another  I was basically about not enough time spent together  trying to think of a situation that I handled differently  sometimes feel guilty about is a divorced that  I did I went through about 7 years ago I should have thought it out  a lot more than I did before I made the decision I did so  I guess if that's the case I guess that would be something that I wish I could have done different  the hardest has not ever had to make was  agreeing to go into the military and I thought about it I didn't want to do it so it was a really hard decision because I knew once I had agreed to do it  to sign my name then I was obligated to go so that was a very hard decision  yes  I was 20  I believe I was 21 between 21 22 years old  I felt like actually going back to that first question I was about 19 years old when I joined the military I felt good about it  it was something I thought about doing and I wanted to do it I felt like it was  becoming of a man back then to join the military and I thought good about it and as I look at it today really kind of  set me up to the point that I'm in my life now with the discipline and the structure of your life and your your family life so it really kind of  molded me into the person that I am at that I am now  are you having a good day  am I happy  yes  I went to the Gulf  I went to the Gulf War  in 1985 I spent six six months in a cup of Romaine in 1985 and that was a really  really tough experience right there for me  very hot very dangerous are in a hostile environment  I was really easy because after 4 years of serving in military I was I was done I was I was over it I was right to get back into civilian world and see what  the civilian world had to offer me  and so far as been good but I'm glad at the same time I'm glad I had that military experience you know that that military back and I have in my back pocket but I was ready for civilian life in  it's been great  author military I worked for  about 14 years as a security officer real nice job good pay unfortunate in 2005  my department was cut out due to the company not willing to negotiate our contract again so after 14 years of that I was let go  IAP made me more more rounded person it made me  see things a little different and civilian life it makes you a little bit stronger and make sure a little bit more discipline than the regular  and a gift your foundation  how to go about your business in civilian life is sort of  commit to me this major  better person all the way around how to accept things I have to accept different peoples in different cultures and it just makes you open up with your your thinking process  have you noticed any changes  I've been feeling  and I'm pretty good lately not as good as I want to feel but I've been I've been I've been feeling okay  how easy is it for you to go  lately has been little bit hard because for some reason my neck have been tightening up on me so it's been a little bit difficult to get a good night sleep. Over the last couple weeks or so  that's been a lot going on  a little bit edgy little bit not attentive a little bit uneasy  those are some of the things that you know normally happens to me when I don't sleep well  no I haven't  I know I haven't  I guess I felt really happy  when I was able to move away from my mother-in-law's house and move into my own house which is about 4 years ago  and I made me really happy because me and my four kids and Kearney at that time my wife was all staying with  my mother-in-law and which we stay there for five years so I thought when we got our house I was so happy because I could do what I want to do I could move around as I wanted to in until  make me happy made my family happy also  I would say my mother course and my brother and my mother course because she's the one that brought me  and my brothers because I sort of see how he goes about his business and I sort of  sort of meaning  so I don't want to go down that same road as he's gone down and so those are my two  role models that she will call it  genuine  upbeat friendly positive  all the  something I did recent that I really enjoyed  nice  having my three kids  thank you  goodbye

625,male,0,2,0,26.0,625,regular and so the virtual human to ask you some questions and then  then Italy speech speech recognition to like I register what you say and then he's a series of  I know what to do back in the reason that the connection webcam is so that it can also take into account your facial expressions and your posture  what is war of the sea  is it a party at college thesis or anything  bring up the virtual human for a second and then shrink  I kind of wish that was really cool I am not doing so yet because I have just finished my second year so  so I don't know yet  what is the first California visit  dislike so right  okay  oh okay  I'm going to start the recording okay  virtual check  and then  and then she said she said  you got it  okay  yes  okay  I'm feeling pretty good  where are you from originally Montgomery Alabama  a lot of the sites of amusement parks lot of different places to go with my children  it's a big city a lot of stars live here so really it's a cool place  no not not anymore I used to but no not not lately in the last few years now  working on a movie set and getting to meet one of my favorite actors and also when I was in the military having being able to travel in Europe in a lot of places I thought I'd never be able to see  my major was business administration minor was history  I Need You Now  actually right now I work part-time I don't have to actually have a steady job but you know I do some work with family members on Home Improvements but the primarily I'm I'm disabled so I don't get a chance to go to work very often at regular job  what's your dream job  oh probably work in some type of entertainment film music that's probably been my dream for years and years and I've kind of dabbled in a little bit but never really made  foothold in that industry  I say outgoing  I just love people always have been a people person like to talk to people probably don't talk to people as much as I used to since it ain't got this missing tooth in my in my smile so it kind of takes away from me being as outgoing as I used to be  relationship with your family  it's pretty good I have three children have to Mom baby moms meaning you know I have two mothers of my kids but primarily my mom and I are pretty close but I have a very large family but we really don't interact that much  when I'm feeling then I turn on the fish tank screensaver  play videogames right read I wish I could get enough get-up-and-go to write a screenplay I've always been wanting to write and you never know what may happen with that but you know if I ever get some get up and go I'll write something but that's primarily what I do  pretty good I haven't done anything crazy or nothing in my life I guess but I do have a tendency to have a little bad temper  when was the law  this was recently argue with a friend over something very silly it was a sports question of something about sports and you know over the years my family are some people in my family have told me there's three things you really don't discuss with people that's politics Sports and religion so I try to stay away from those subjects  that's a great question I worked for a restaurant downtown who was which was owned by a very affluent lawyer in Los Angeles  the only reason I'm mentioning his name because he's very prominent lawyer and not only in California but this what's this country and I lost a job they're getting into an argument with the manager of the restaurant but in actuality the owners is partner we're very very kind and they really liked me a lot and I should have never let that situation get to that  something you feel guilty about  I think  probably not spending more time with my children or actually spending time with my oldest daughter who lives in Maryland I feel guilty for not having been more of a success in my life  not having as much drive and determination as I should have that's probably my biggest no regret or what I feel is guilty about  tell me about  probably the hardest decision I've ever had to make was to join the military I had heard a lot of bad things about it at her good things about it but at that particular time of my life I had a you know a fork in the road and I had to choose where they go left to right and I chose to go left and joined the army and turned out it wasn't that bad of a decision  tell me about midnight or something that  haven't been a rat being arrested years and years ago  that's 20 years to be exact and it hasn't really affected me employment wise or anything like that but it's but it's it was on my record and it was something that should have been avoided but it happened and I just wish I could take that one back  yes  20 or 21 years old  well three reasons one I needed a change in my life to I had some personal things going on I felt it was time to like you know just taking advantage of her and try something different and I just wasn't really happy in my college experience so I thought I'd try it  are you happy  yes  no but I can't close  I worked I was in the military when the Russians were still prevalent in Eastern Europe and we did some board of Duty between the East and West Germany and there are few incidences On the Border that could have gotten out of hand but never did  fairly easy  since since leaving the military in 1990 I found myself not being able to kind of interact with people as much as I used to you know things being that I was in the military you think that was a would be a little easier having live with people so close to you all the time but it actually made me a little bit more anxious and have little more anxiety around people  I came back to Los Angeles and decided to move to Georgia and spent four years in Georgia working and going to school a little bit and then came back to Los Angeles four years later after 1990  on the positive side I was physically fit when I got out very physically fit and enjoy being that way for several years until you know of some things happened in my life to where I kind of let myself go  but it changed me and made me more  orderly place things in perspective  emotionally pretty good physically tired  I didn't notice any change.  If anything I would say  just started wanting to have more and do more in my life that's about it  fairly easy I usually  go to sleep and sleep well some nights I toss and turn but it's rare and I would say it's rare but you know once I get to sleep I sleep fairly well  hello are visible in the mornings but since I live alone and a lot of people don't really feel that so  but that ain't none of my kids are around it's it's always more enjoyable to wake up cuz you know I can see their faces and and enjoy their company  yes  no I haven't actually been diagnosed with depression but I have bats of that every now and then  fairly recently I have my kids over for the weekend and I we had a good time enjoying each other's company so I was pretty happy man  I would probably say Pastor from my church her name is Pastor Beverly Allan she's been kind of a mentor for me for several years and she's a bit of a really big influence in my life and always kind of been there for me  tell your best friend  hopefully well they would say I was funny you know reliable steady and you know primarily upbeat person  I like to bowl so when we go bowling  play begin a bunch of guys will go out we'll go bowling just have a good evening and you know enjoying each other's company and trying to kick each other's butt on the Bowling  my children  they're my pride and joy then extension of me once I pass away the bill live on I live on through them so it's just an honor to know your have three healthy children that are happy very intelligent and maybe make a good Market Society  thank you  goodbye
626,male,0,0,0,18.0,626,some of those pictures all right  yes  I'm fine  where you from  Los Angeles  I like beach the city have a closed everything is do anything here  the traffic  sometimes I've been quite a few places  getting away trying to go see other places other historical sightings  just recently I went to Italy we went and saw Pisa and Rome and Florence and Natalie  I'm studying aeronautics  right now I'm unemployed  to design uavs  Mariah Kelly  I like to be at the middle of things  it's all right if you know my mom's left  I play video games or watch movies  good only has anger problems  I don't even remember  I really can't think of anything  something you feel guilty about  I don't really feel guilty about anything  that would be joining the Army  don't really have anything that like to erase my memory  yes  24  my wife was kind of stuck so I needed to change something up for me was a good choice  yes  yeah I did one combat tour  pretty easy it wasn't a real rough deployment  I am going back to school  I don't really think it changed me all that much I met him might be more responsible now  just one  not much to tell just going day-by-day I feel fine  nope  pretty easy I sleep I  I'm like a zombie  no  nope  I don't know  my wife my best friend  mint shape makes me want to be better  awesome  I spend most of my time working on my cars that got to project cars are a lot of fun  nice  my relationship with my wife  okay
629,male,0,0,0,20.0,629,to respond to you and keep  Mount taal Interactive  expressions in your posture  I'm so lonely  will she pick up on my  fight  okay  okay  so two things  Booker  everyone  absolutely okay  and so she can ask you a series of questions and then at the end she'll say goodbye and then you'll press this button  yes  I'm doing quite well  I am from West Covina California  the sports teams I like the Lakers the Dodgers and the USC football  and  and the weather  the traffic don't like the traffic at all and  other than that it's probably probably probably yet  no not right now I am in a job that they're just commute back and forth about 12 miles so that's about as the extent of my traveling  what do I enjoy about traveling probably seeing new places when I due to trouble seeing new places and people from different states different countries and picking up on their cultures  one of my trips let's see  I have a friend in Atlanta Georgia and he works for the TV that work down there and when the Dodgers were playing in Atlanta I took a trip to go see him and we went to go see the games as well Atlanta is a good nice Sports Town hot and muggy but we could deal with it as much like here the expressways are about the same traffic they have their own traffic problems but it was really good experience I got to see and meet people from Atlanta Georgia and it was really nice time  one of my most memorable experiences is being in the Marine Corps and liberating Kuwait  that was probably the one of the the best experiences of my of my life  we had a little resistance and trouble from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait and liberate Kuwait City and there was it was great  what I studied at school basically was broadcasting and the radio and cuz I was a radio operator in the Marine Corps so I could study broadcasting I am but I also love history  what do you do now  what do I do now I am a part-time broadcaster for  and it is  and basically operator engineer and run all the programming from satellite sources and a lot of programs  what is my dream job good question probably  similar to what I have in the Marine Corps I was a Sergeant Marine Corps had my own Squad so if I could have being in a management position where I have my own crew and take care of my own crew and look after their needs that would probably be my dream position  it depends on the kind of mood I'm in sometimes I am I feel shy and just want to stay home other times I'm a little  outgoing I want to go out with my friends and and go to dinner and have drinks and watch a sporting event  why cuz I'm feeling good and I want to feel company of my friends and just want to talk and Converse  how good relationship with my family my mother is like one of my best friends I have confide in her with basically all of my problems and good things my dad is is very good man we get along very well and I have three sisters that the two of them I see on a regular basis and one of them I really don't but we're all we're close family  I know it's  what do I do to relax  is a my apartment complex I have a Jacuzzi so I spend 20 minutes in the jacuzzi and go for a swim afterwards or I will go on a bike ride I have my own mountain bike and I like to travel 5 miles then get to work out it so when I'm feeling since I go get a workout  concussion I'm sometimes it's it's very hard but I have to look at myself in and limit myself on what the possible consequences of an uproar of my upper could could lead to so whether to be with my family or my co-workers I have to always look at my soft before I get very angry and and temperament that temperamental  no I don't think so no  a good question last time I got into argument  was probably with my Dad we I go visit my parents and they have a pool and a pond trying to clean the pool we had a disagreement so we had an argument  a situation where I wish I was at sea  I was  downsize from a full-time position back in December of 2012  and I think I could have probably avoided it if I read the signs probably work a little harder and  and probably  I don't know  I'm done a better job at that position  something I feel guilty about  ask a question I don't think I feel really guilty everything I have done I have  lived up to you and not felt guilty about having wrong to anybody  in particular  and that not that I feel guilty I don't feel guilty about everything  hardest decision I've ever had to make sure she probably when I was 17 years old sign a contract to join the Marine Corps and it was a six-year contract and  I know that was probably a lot for my family but it's something I wanted to do but it was a really hard one and  I made it and I live through it the six years and I think I am better for  something I could have erased from my memory at sea  let's see I'm trying to think  probably  I've got into to bar fights so probably limiting the alcohol use some of those some of those times and avoided trouble in the bars  yes I have  I was 18  I wanted the toughest challenge for an 18 year old and I thought the and I knew that the Marine Corps would give it to me so I took it  are you happy  absolutely yes  yes now I was in Desert Storm  pretty easy to get used to growing my hair out again cuz I had it really short for 6 years and I really didn't like getting haircuts every week  other than that I went too soon as I got out I went to broadcasting school and everything pretty much went back to normal  I went to broadcasting school and then I I got a radio job in Palm Desert California and that was my first grader job but I don't know I work there for three months and I forgot a job in Riverside so after that I kept getting jobs and till now I've worked in radio for 22 years  it changed me because I am more disciplined self this fund pay attention to detail more attention to detail than I ever have kind of a mental thing paying attention to detail but they drilled it into our heads  pretty plainly I like to keep  everything in its place and I like to keep ficked nobody taught me  in general been feeling really well I've been exercising  four times a week either swimming or bike riding and or both so I've been I've been feeling really well I can't complain  I know I've always stated pretty even Keel and I like to like to keep it that way I don't like to get too low or get too high I like to stay stay even-keeled  it is pretty pretty easy when I work out a lot but there are sometimes when I I do if I'm not a 5-mile bike ride and then I I I swim like 10 laps in the pool those days are easy for me to get a good night's sleep and some of the other days where I just do a bike ride or a swim but not both of those are pretty easy to sew  sometimes I have too much energy but the  but when I work out that energy yet I seem to have a good night sleep  what am I like when I don't sleep well well I get up and I am really groggy and tired and I have to have at least three cups of coffee and that usually gives me the energy that I need for the whole day  no I have never have  I recently had a checkup from the from the VA and everything was was perfect so I'd I do not have PTSD  again I am at my last physical I was asked if I was feeling depressed and I told him no and they did tests and determined that I wasn't wasn't a depressed person so I never feel depressed I always feel you killed it and never feel depressed  the last time I felt really happy and well I'm a big sports fan so whenever sports teams do well especially the Dodgers which they have been doing really well lately keeps me happy and I like to see my favorite teams do well because I feel on the part of the team because I attend the games and support the team and I like to do like to see them succeed so basically it's baseball season right now but football season is around the Home Run basketball teams in the hockey season so epic sports fans to one of my teams do album I am I am feeling really really good  somebody that's been a positive influence in my life I would say my parents they've been married since 1955 so I'm going up on almost 70 years 60 years 60 years so  I think my parents my mom is a big influence and she's a very good woman and taught us to be very good people so I would say my parents  my best friend describe me as determined  driven  and willing to succeed I would think  something I did recently in which I really enjoyed let's see  hide recently went  toys for game with my boss and it was a couple weeks ago and we had really good seats from from the team and we had a great night. The food we had hot dogs and and french fries and the and the Dodgers won in the bottom of the night so it was a really really good game and it was a good experience  most proud of being a marine serve six years in the Marine Corps around the Desert Storm veteran so Tuesday to the rank of Sergeant at the at 22 years old so I am grateful and most proud to be a United States Marine  thank you  we buy

634,female,0,2,0,18.0,634,okay hold on what you said she should stay good but in French  friendship  okay  okay  yes  I'm doing good thanks  I'm from Los Angeles in California  I love the beach I love the weather and I love all there but things there are to do here  I don't like the smog I don't like the traffic and that might be those might be the thing at the top of my list  which have a little bit yes  we enjoy packing the kids up getting them in a different environment helping them to learn about different cultures and experiencing those cultures to the fullest and just getting away  a couple years ago we took the kids to Acapulco for Thanksgiving and it's not normally a time of the year that we travel but we thought we try something different and it was a great experience for them we did all kinds of things that we normally wouldn't would not have done so with an opportunity to sort of stretch our Horizons and experience some new things and we actually had a really great time  one of my most memorable experiences in terms of travel I guess was the time that my luggage got lost in front of Vallarta and I spent the week I'm wearing my husband shorts and t-shirt  I went to a fashion  for two years and then after that I got my bachelor's  now I'm a real estate agent that has nothing to do with the subject that I studied in college but it's as the great career nonetheless  my dream job would still be in real estate but it might be such that I have the financial means that I can just do it because I love it I love helping people secure their first properties I work with a lot of first-time buyers it's their way into wealth management I like educating people on the process I would probably still want to be in the business of real estate I might actually delve more into income property ownership but it would still be something in real estate  definitely more outgoing  I have a good relationship  I work out to relax usually three to five times a week I work out in the mornings and it does help to manage stress and in real estate and being a mom there is lots of stress in my life  getting better at it not the best at it I tend to be very outwardly with my emotions and I'm learning to try to check them out the door a lot more than I used to so I can work in progress  it probably was the person was probably my husband and the timeframe may have been a month or so ago and quite honestly I don't remember what it was about so that I told you that it was probably something that was not even important  I wish that  I wish that I would argue with my husband less especially in front of our kids  I feel guilty about arguing with my husband in front of my kids is something that they should be apart from and separate from and not even not even be included in that  tell me about the hardest.  It was probably the decisions had let my daughter move forward with the heart surgery that the doctor says that she need it but it was it was a very scary time and place for us but we we move forward with it was a decision that I did not make a loan I made it along with my husband  an event that I wish I could erase from my memory would be  as an as a child being touched any of her inappropriately by a family member  no  I've been feeling fine  I've been feeling fine this summer the work stress is still there but my kids are out of school so our household is a lot more relaxed my son is actually in Sacramento for the past couple of weeks so it's just my husband and my daughter and I and we're sort of taking a little bit of a laid-back approach to Summer before our vacation comes up  have you noticed any changes  no  I'm pretty easy over the last two to three weeks I think there was one night or I had so much on my mind I just find it hard to fall asleep but in general I do sleep well  what workouts help with that as well  I just sort of not as social a little more quiet  lag  ragging  no I have not  no  today or yesterday just the ability to be blessed to wake up every day and I have an opportunity to make the best day that I can  that's that's a blessing so I'm happy about that every day  my mother is definitely a positive influence in my life she is someone that I go to and confidence all the time she's a very spiritual woman and always seems to lead me appointment in the right direction  my best friend actually passed away so I will I will use my husband who was a really good friend actually in at this point he is my best friend and he would probably describe me as someone who lives my life passionately who is very dedicated and loyal and who wears her emotions on her sleeve  on Saturday my husband my daughter and I just we were in Burbank handling some business and after that it was so hot and my daughter asked if we could go to Sherman Oaks Galleria to hang out and it was not something that was my choice but it was just really nice to be able to hang out and I really casual environment and do something that that she wanted to do and I really please her and we went shopping and we had a we had a really good time but ordinarily I would have never chose that activity but because my husband and I were able to throw whatever other plans we head out the window and just enjoy her and ended up being a nice family outing  nice  I'm proud of my children I have a 7 year old daughter and a nine-year-old son and I'm very proud of the way that they are are growing up and that their character and their academic skills and really that the little people that they have become  thank you  goodbye

636,female,1,15,1,62.0,636,"you just look at Ali so she's asking a series of questions and then using yes all right  I was born in Philadelphia but we lived all over that the place so I'm not from Philadelphia to just before in there and live there for a year  I love the weather people are generally more friendly than where I've lived on the East Coast the scenery the environment the beach the mountains the bike paths and the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables  the usual the traffic I guess some of the people in the entertainment business a bit of the materialism and you know when you meet like the stereotypical deaths  I used to when I used to have a life I been to 41 countries and I really enjoyed that  wish I could do it again one day  I guess since I'm from nowhere it's fun to go somewhere where  it doesn't you don't have to fit in your already a weirdo so it doesn't matter that you're not from the place and I just really enjoy eating meeting people from different cultures I love seeing new environments I love seeing historical things are now just things been credible Beauty I love meeting different types of people food I love different food so any foods for money foreign Land Rovers fun and any other thing I secretly like that I try not to get too wrapped up in is that if you can completely and utterly escaped and forget about your real life  how to write let me think for a minute  I don't know which one to pick  I guess I  I'm trying to think in my head I probably shouldn't be overthinking I'm trying to think do I pick a horrible one to give you guys more emotion or do I pick a normal what are my traveling companion was my  you know husband too I don't know what his story is I suppose he's gay  so we went to to Singapore and it was just fabulous I except for the parts having to deal with him I loved being there and you know the variety of delicious unbelievable food I'm a huge kraylix I've been so that was really fun it's a big shopping place so I kind of wished I were a bit younger cuz they had fabulous fashions  I like the weather cuz it was hot and steamy it was really easy to get around  things like that  let's see for some reason I'm thinking of a bad one nothing I assume you mean towards travel when I was traveling through Vietnam and Cambodia I got a really bad case of hemorrhoids hemorrhagic dengue fever  I was in hiding  why wasn't I was in accentuate sorry in Vietnam and I was horribly sick and I was hallucinating and my traveling companion husband person I  I said please go get me some water I was in a really sweating profusely and I've been very sick for a while and he went out to get the water I don't know sometime in the morning and he came back and I don't know 7 at night or something and said that he some fellow on a motorbike instead let me take you somewhere where you can get some water and I don't know what the hell you did all day long so I just think back to then and I remember coming in and out of Consciousness and thinking I'm going to die here and I wondered if I would ever be and I found in this hotel we were staying so I don't know how I survived and I'm probably over dramatizing it but  it was just memorable because I often think back and when I see people sick or whatever and think she why the heck did I survive  that's not my PTSD thing though if you're wondering  I studied  film as an undergrad while I started off and dance and then I realized I wasn't really that talented I mean I was okay but not really that good so I moved over to film and I really enjoyed that and then later on in life I went back to school and I became a lawyer  I'm an underemployed  lawyer I guess I I got tossed out with many people you know I Now understand why the what-do-you-call-it the the age discrimination laws kick in after 40 well you know it's extremely difficult to get rehired so now I have a couple of clients I make a couple of pennies you know  would prefer to be fully employed not really going so well  so I'm here today to make my 35 measly bucks  does after paying off all those loans and everything for law school because I stupidly took one of the more expensive law schools in the country so many of you students listening don't do that I mean don't pick an expensive grad school if you don't get financial aid and you don't have a financial help from your family so anyway I because I was spent all my life paying off my undergrad and my graduate schools I now find myself looking down the barrel of long-term unemployment and retirement and not having any you know any insurance or any  enough for a what they say we're supposed to live to in the future  not anymore I don't I don't have any dreams left  when I was younger and my dream job is to be an ambassador because I thought it would just be so much fun to you no have contact with different countries and to get to be friendly and meet people all the time and to represent your country in a positive way  I know I don't think I have any dreams left I am too old I've  I've nothing at the world once anymore  well I was always extremely outgoing and friendly up until maybe I don't know 5 years ago and then I  I guess I'm so friendly and outgoing I just  sometimes I just give up and I don't even try anymore  well it's embarrassing when people say what do you do to say you're unemployed people think I've had so many people say well why don't you just go out and get a job will what are they assume that you're being lazy or something like that where it's like okay assholes at work since I was 12 you know right I didn't have fun during college I worked three jobs to pay for it all and my lungs I don't know I guess I'd I just stopped trying because and I'm a little embarrassed about my situation you know I'm  quote on quote married to somebody who has this secret life I don't know what his story is I guess I'm embarrassed about my  my life being so pretty much a complete and utter failure of every every goal that I had  I go for a bike ride along you lovely bike path I go swimming  on occasion I will drink have a drink have a low alcohol tolerance so basically one or two will pretty much knocked me out I don't know I used to do yoga and stuff like that nowadays I try to do deep breathing  it depends who the person is in a normal situation with normal people or with complete strangers  I'm pretty darn good at it  with two people I'm no longer any good at it at all my husband and my mother cuz they were both extremely  physically and emotionally abusive and I finally learned recently on the last maybe 10 years or so that that's the stuff they had that I accepted as normal was not normal so I did all the assertiveness thing where you say this is not no please don't lie to me or whatever the thing they were doing and you know the person supposed to say oh I didn't know that was hurting you let me change but of course that never actually works in real life so now I find that if I must have contact with these people of HIV one of them have to I get extremely if they lie to me I just get fed up and you know  confront them on it  well  what can you give me a chance I guess it was my husband since I'm paying the cell phone bill and he's on the family plan it turned out that he had 44 pages of text while he's off on the secret trip to some summer camp don't ask I don't I don't even want to think about it I don't know who these people are that he's texting with so I asked him what the f are you these text who are you doing this with and I tried calling some of the numbers and the people would just hang up on me so you know my imagination started thinking what the hell is he doing at this summer camp why did the people that he's texting and texting photos to not respond you know draw your own conclusions so you know any wasn't answering me and he kept lying and he's one sentence emails he was sending back so I  you know I started getting these threats in the e-mails back like oh yeah well if you don't tell me I'm going to call up this number and find out who they were which he wouldn't answer me and then as I said I called and they're just hung up on me so who knows who these people  well I mean there are the General Life ones like I wish I had never married this person I situation I wish I'd handled differently  I guess I had a job  I actually was a head lawyer for a company probably won't believe it now you guys were out there watching this and the the president started doing all these things that were ethically wrong and going against my advice and I should have gotten the Hades out of there I should have quit immediately but I was still paying off you know $200,000 worth of student loan so but I just should have gotten out of there  gee willikers  well  I just see the only real thing I feel guilty about is something I prefer not to discuss on tape I mean I've had enough drinks tell me over the years that I was justified  hardest decision I tried to make I don't know I mean every stupid a lot of decisions have been difficult the hardest one I've no idea  the last 49 years  I I guess I could erase my big pts State when I was 18 a serial killer  abducted me and I escaped from that I  now I haven't  I don't know you know  sing along  I don't know  neither here nor there I'm just numb anymore I don't really care I'm just waiting for you know to die  well I kind of had a bad blow last week with something  and  I just didn't have an appetite for like I don't know 5 days and horrible thing is I didn't lose a single pound  I don't know  let's say I didn't have hunger so I didn't eat and didn't seem to affect my body at all  well I seem to have developed some horrible neck pain and  that's made things doubly difficult the second thing is that I because I'm always plagued by these horrible nightmares they're actually just actual events of actually happen to me just replaying over and over I am an internet addict and I just put stuff on YouTube or or whatever on all night long and you know I frequently have loud loud sounds so I don't sleep that well and I have a horrible horrible that at the moment and live in a very noisy place  why do I live in a noisy place because I have been unemployed as I told her underemployed as I told you when I don't have money to live in a place that should be the equal of all the hard work I've done in my life  you're looking at it you know like anybody would be my I don't feel that well I'm tired I  I don't know just tired  yes a couple people that I've met with have told me that I I had it  the first time I don't know  maybe 15  the recurring nightmares the  I don't know I I I developed anxiety and I freaked out you know if I think I'm going to run out of gas I get short of breath and  I don't know in the soup I used to be able to handle anything now something stupid happens and I catastrophize it and think that it's going to be horrific so I have to talk myself out of it  hello I've lost all the ability to trust and I'm numb to all feelings partly  I will let you know what you said  well you  I think my PTSD I was fine and I had it after the eighteen-year-old incident I just fine and dandy and then something happens in the last like decade I just had hit after hit after hit and it just brought everything back up and or maybe it's cuz I'm not that busy anymore so I'm time to ruminate over all these horrible things and I've said Elaine thing I'm way worse now than I was after the you know escaping from a serial killer I mean  kind of kind of pain in the neck I'll literally  I'm not being healthy I will  you know  drink a couple things of alcohol which I don't I don't know something's wrong with my heart they told me and  so any more you know even if I have just one causes a lot of pain and stuff or I try to do stuff to relax or you know if I'm having a really really bad day I might  I might it myself or hurt myself and some other way  threat because after you after you do that releases all in all you're all freaked out and then if you hurt yourself you got really distracted like how come you know this really hurts and then you don't really think about the horrible thing that was in your head anymore you're thinking about I've got this  I have tried to get help I can't get any help now I don't have any insurance I can't I'm not poor enough I would need to go through all of my retirement savings and be penniless to get any free help so I mean I'd like to be a normal person again and I'd like to be happy I'd like to be a functioning human you know like I used to be  no  I don't have the money and nobody cares about you know lower-middle-income class people  you know I've been to a zillion cerum not a gazillion but you know I don't know 15 therapist maybe over my 30 years or whatever it is been sometimes you got somebody that's good  and I found that the younger the person the better actually like a cup one when I was in law school I went to see someone or when my father died when I was 18 at the same time that other thing happens I I saw some students they were actually the best ones the worst ones seem to be the ones that are like in my age category or older cuz it kind of checked out and they just want somebody who's there but in terms of like I don't know how I did that young MD whatever think it was called once and  I'm really work sometimes you get a new gets like wants some therapist said to me you don't want to kill yourself you just want a different life so when I am suicidal I just think of that sends I don't want to kill myself I just want a different life so is sometimes you get a nougat but you know generally it hasn't really saved me yet  do I have to I just did sometimes you get us a good therapist oh one thing I learned is that most therapists are actually more screwed up than me you know I may seem screwed up to you guys here but you know at least I used to be able to function I was somewhat successful and I I've never intentionally hurt people I don't screw people over I'm not dishonest in my work compassionate and I found so many therapists you know they live their little teeny lives in Suburbia or whatever the heck they're from and they're totally incapable of  relating to anything that's outside of their world  I haven't been as I told you so but I did go I noticed that it was fun to go somewhere once a week and have somebody listen to your for Tales of Woe although sometimes it got frustrating the person was not helpful  really happy  I've been trying to cultivate it the last night I was on the bike path and I looked around at the beautiful nature things and there were briefs literally seconds where I had it and then him some aggressive bike ride or somebody else to come along and that would be destroyed but otherwise more than perhaps a brief second or a couple of seconds  I don't even know I don't even know oh oh oh  it is good  oh my God are you even listening  I don't think you're listening very carefully you like some of the strings I've had  people is that what you wanted me to tell you about I  I don't even know what the question was anymore to tell you the truth  sorry  no just the empty silence that I'm supposed to be filling to answer or you  what was the question  I don't know sometimes therapies helpful sometimes it's not  show the happiness that was a question sometimes I've had half my happiest moment was when I climbed up inside the Great Pyramid of Giza that was extremely hot I don't know it's just wonderful  wonderful feeling I'm claustrophobic so I was proud that I made it through there and it was just an amazing sight  Cassius is a test to see how one reacts when there's an uncomfortable silence  am I supposed to be pushing the button for the person to come in now  all right she did stop talking  I thought it was a test of how one reacts during an uncomfortable side"
637,female,1,16,0,49.0,637,"okay  I think I got it  what year Buick Minnie Mouse so that were okay like that  okay  okay  and then  and right now she can't answer any  yes  fine  San Francisco  the beaches fire pits the ocean movies entertainment business the different areas as  the weather  it's really difficult to get around by bus terrible not having a car  that's the hardest part you can't really do all day without a car  in every way  by bus I do  my most memorable experiences  what do they study at school I studied I'm sitting acting right now is what I'm doing  I'm studying acting and I'm working a day job that doesn't pay enough money so I'm trying to find additional day jobs or I don't know how to I'm trying to figure out how to live with joy  that's how to live with joy that's when your life flows is when you do more of what brings you Joy that's my current  dilemma  I think my dream job would be weighing 70 lbs less and being a really emotionally diverse actress so I can play comedy roles which is easier for me and too heavy drama rolls which is more of a challenge to be vulnerable and to open up emotionally kind of what I'm standing right now and I would look thousand percent better cuz my hair would be long  I really am thinking I don't have a family anymore my father passed away and there's no relationship with my sister and a very poor one with my mother so it's almost like not having any family anymore  sometime  take a shower  pretty good  I guess it was a couple months ago and  I was a friend that kind of flipped out on me  that would be the situation  I wish I did handle it differently  infidelity  that's a good question  the hardest decision I've ever had to make well I had an amazing cat and  if you can imagine it was more than a cat it was like being a very large entity in the body of a cat and my cat passed away and I had to I wanted to have a proper burial at an animal cemetery and have a memorial service for my cat and my mother was against these ideas that was too much for a cat and so it took me two and a half months to come up with the money to find his casket and to decide on what style of casket I wanted because it was so hard to own that decision when I didn't get any support over it  but eventually I triumphed and I found an artisan in Tennessee that makes Cedar chests and he made me the most beautiful Cedar casket octagono  octagon all with Ivory lining and plush padding on the inside of the casket and the people at the animal Cemetery said that in 20 years of business they'd never seen such a beautiful casket and they'd never seen someone that gave so much to their animal  so I felt really really good when I saw the way that I was sort of like a sending my cat and I went to the cemetery  then I get erased from my memory I think I have erased a lot of events from my memory  well I probably had a lot of them  weird experiences  definitely  no  well you know I'm a very determined human being so I work myself into being in positive states of mind but overall I think that definitely realizing I have some deep depression and essentially I just need more of a support network here in La I need to create a new family and that's basically what I need to renew a really do which is difficult because it's hard to have a family and family and friends you know people that you can really really trust and it's just hard to get around La without a car  so I feel a lack of support in my life and I feel isolated and lonely  other than that I'm very optimistic  any changes yeah I walk to work which is in Beverly Hills and I walk through Beverly Hills and I noticed that even though I'm walking around nice places I'm a joyless when I'm walking to work doesn't really make me that happy makes me happier when I get to the commercial part and there's more people around and there's lots of kind of like activity and shops it does nothing for me like walking through the neighborhoods I noticed  I noticed that I have a lot of lethargy in my body which is depression  I'm really working hard at going to sleep before midnight and I noticed that it makes a big difference when I do get enough sleep  I'm fine I'm just tired but I think I'm pretty fine energy-wise in terms of interacting with other people  PTSD no  yes  recently  lethargy lack of Joy lack of community lack of close bonds  lack of focus  support network no one to talk to not a lot of energy  to do extra things that would you know help make your life better it's just sort of get into the struggle of just getting through the day  and then trying to find the energy to do something to make it better  I need to buy something  yeah I think I know what my overall trigger what the overall thing is but it's deeper than the overall thing itself  that makes any sense well  I  you guys are going to think I'm a complete whack job but honestly I'm really not I called my mother yesterday and I left her a message and at the end of the message I said I love you and that's a month since she called me which was my birthday when she called me I didn't answer but she didn't say she loves me the year before that she didn't even call me on my birthday and she said she wasn't feeling well  and we had a falling out in November so I haven't spoken to her since the following out but essentially what I realized in November was just a tremendous amount of inability to love that she has towards me and I think it's a lifelong thing so I think it's hard for me to get close to people and to bond with people because if you can't trust your mother who can you trust and if you haven't received love from your mother  and you don't know really how to receive Love Actually something about receiving lover  receiving self-worth or validation or something like that I think that lack of support you know throughout my whole life regardless of how ambitious or determined I am the there's an underpinning really everyday you know of sadness about that not having a mother and so that's I think the main challenge to workout in my psyche or Soul or emotions  something like that  how do I cope with my emotions well I sit with them alone mainly since there's no one to  share the deeper ones with that would really understand me there was no long-term relationships  but I do interact with my emotions a lot when I'm turning my instrument and in acting class and so that's a big you know workout emotionally  a couple months ago I went through a patch where I didn't have a place to stay and ended up staying with someone that I thought was the student friend she turned out to be crazy and I had to leave there and as a result  I had to seek counseling / the Mandate of my school  that's the incident that triggered it  yes  therapy is useful  it's a reflective experience so your reflective throughout the week before you see your therapist and then you sort of start thinking on a deeper level about a seam occurrence seeing that's like what's really the issue and then it feels very look forward to having someone to talk to you that can really listen so the gift of active listening  and then feeling of satisfaction from another human being caring  about you your welfare and having someone to talk to you on a deeper level  when I was in my acting class which was well I took some classes I audited some classes last week and it does moments lot of joy, and when I was at my school studying which was at two and a half months ago  who's been a positive influence in my life that would be  the most positive influence was my cat's Benjamin and my former partner  and  no best friends at the moment  I went to UCB and saw Improv  I'm most proud of my care for my cat  and  I'm most proud of my relationship with my cat and I'm most proud of that I have been making a lot of progress in a working on my career stuff and I have a positive attitude even though it's very difficult growing up with the family that doesn't give you the kind of emotional or financial support so grown up with a lot of jealousy and negativity and lack of support  you're welcome goodbye"

want to I want to start moving into Finance I want to do something financial-related investment-banking I think I'm going to switch course pretty soon here  I'm a little bit more shy  my family is good we're a little bit closed we don't we don't show a lot of emotion and we're not is as loving you know over the phone or in person but you know we have other ways to show our emotions  yeah  I usually I'll just watch a movie or go to the movies go to the park I have a small dog so I like taking him around the block so that they usually relaxes me a bit  how are you  I'm usually pretty good I don't really get extremely angry very often and I keep a lot of my emotions inside which isn't always good but you know I never have crazy angry outbursts and get violent or anything like that  when was the last  the last time I argued with someone was a few weeks ago we are actually in Las Vegas and you know we were with a big group of people and we are just trying to decide where to go and one of my friends was pretty adamant about one place and it was unappealing to the rest of the group so you know I got a little confrontational but everything worked out in the end  tell me about  I think the passing of my my mom's dad I wish I would have been a little more loving and an emotional to my mom about it you know it was a very difficult time for her friend  I should have been there a little bit more than I was  I feel guilty about just not being as as loving and caring to my parents I mean they've they've done a lot for me and provided a lot and I don't know he's really show my appreciation to them I think as much as I wish I should so  tell me about the hardest decision  the hardest decision I ever  something that I wish was erased would certainly be when I was pulled over for a DUI very embarrassing moment but you know I wish that it never happened  have you ever seen  how have you been feeling lately  I've been a little bit sad I had another death in the family recently my uncle passed away a couple weeks ago so it's been a little bit difficult on all of us and you know we're all spread out around the country so it's  stuff we can't really you know be together in person so  makes it difficult  how do you notice  I just recently I mean I think I've been a little a little more bummed out and  you know down a little bit more than you know normal so you know I'm sure it'll turn around soon but some of these things just take time to heal  tell me more about that  well you know whenever you lose someone close to you in a family you know it's very difficult for everyone and the you know different people show their emotions differently so you know for me I tend to keep a lot of it in and then I'll be a little more beneficial if I was able to express it to someone more but you know I don't really feel comfortable doing that all the time so  hopefully things get better  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep it's very difficult cuz I work a lot of strange hours to so I'm up in a working late and then got to get up early and sometimes I can sleep in more so you know if I'm not in a set routine it makes it a little more difficult but you know I usually get a decent amount of sleep as often as possible so I usually don't have too much trouble in that sense  what are you  fell asleep while I'm usually a little just bit more irritable more grumpy you know smaller things can set me off a little bit but you know I have certain techniques to relax a little bit more so you know whenever that happens I'm I'm usually able to handle myself appropriately  have you ever been diagnosed with  no  no  when is the last time  the last time was probably about three weeks ago when I was in Las Vegas visiting some friends and had some other friends come out to visit that I hadn't seen in a while so that was a fun happy time for the weekend  my dad is always been you know of a good role model to me professional and you know I always been there regardless of what I've been going through so I certainly look up to him and appreciate everything he's done for me  he would describe me as being pretty social outgoing but a little bit more shy and reserved so you know friendly caring honest and unreliable  great  what's something you did  something that I recently did that they enjoyed was completing a big project for someone I built a large website that have been a big project for a while and it's been taking up a lot of my time so finally getting that finished and taken care of was a big relief and weight off my shoulders  nice  what are you most proud of in your life  most proud of my family they've always been there for me I've gone through a lot of tough times when I was younger and you know they've always been there

city life and the fast pace  what are some things you don't  cost of living is pretty expensive  you travel a lot  not recently I traveled mostly while I was in the military  why  the military is always on the go so most of the travel being so expensive  I could only afford it through traveling on Military business  for the military or outside of the military  what you said  akademiks foreign languages  private security  okay  what's your dream job  probably in the same industry private security that would be high paying  or something along the lines of mental health for  something like what we're doing right now  was it helps provide for the family pay the bills  you consider yourself more shy  more outgoing than shy  well I'm  I watch TV and spend time with my family  very good actually very very controlled I have two in my field  it was with my wife and it was about finances  wish you would  that's a good question  I believe I  coming to California and leaving my oldest daughter's in Florida  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had  leaving the military it was for finances and  and I knew I had to go so I 1997 I made the choice and all I had known was the military so that was pretty hard  tell me about Nevada  probably some of my past before the military  I was in a relationship  not a not a girlfriend boyfriend relationship I was  basically victimized by my mother I wish I could erase that but in a way it kind of makes me who I am  yes almost 9 years US Air Force  18 years old  had no other choice it was either go in the military or stay out on the streets in New York City I had no money for college and no chance of getting a good job so I enlisted  are you happy you did that yes absolutely probably the best choice Inn in fixing  my life growing up that I ever made  three separate times yes  I had some Growing Pains at first it was a little bit difficult in the beginning but I adjusted  private security  and then law enforcement  it gave me a sense of  sense of regimentation it gave me  structure that I wouldn't have otherwise gotten and I believe as far as within people  and in just the the general population that does set you aside with set you apart  alright I guess in a bit of a struggle sometimes  just seeking employment and it's very difficult especially with the way things are  have you noticed any changes in your  not really just trying to trying to land that dream job as you said before  pretty easy especially if I've been active throughout the day and that's usually every day  what are you like  tired first of all  and can't concentrate well  yes I have  long time ago  my goodness 19  90  1992  1992  cold sweats  nightmares night terrors  disorientation waking up  not knowing where I am  things of that sort  are you triggered by something  not that I'm aware of it was  it was almost mostly  following one of my combat experiences in South America  I went to Columbia  one on President Bush's War on Drugs and  we had the  wait we had to live in the jungle and while in the jungle we also had to take a couple of lives while we were there we so that was one of the three instances that I saw Combat Action  I learned a long time ago that you have to put your past behind you so  I I just do I had to put it behind me it was  not easy  but it was the right thing  to do and it was so That Others May Live so it was it may not have felt right at the time but it was the right thing to do  what country is this  in the military when you have a combat-related experience you always go through a debrief  at the debrief you are asked if you need help coping with the situation  so of course I immediately raised my hand told him I need help with coping with the situation it took roughly about  want to say somewhere around three weeks to a month of seeing a therapist  and  once they they gave me some key exercises to do the the acuteness of the night terrors in the nightmares went away  it was at first  and very seldom am I bothered by it now because it was so long ago  no absolutely not  why did you stop  I didn't need it anymore I learned enough coping skills that we're good enough to be able to cast that aside and not depend upon any facet of treatment or anything else  you feel therapy in Haysville  yes I do feel it is  throwing medication at that kind of problem  sometimes it's necessary but in my case I don't feel it is and I will not be dependent upon medications but the therapy 100% I agree especially speaking to somebody when I'm one it does help  can you tell me about that  tell you about the therapy and how effective it is  I don't go to therapy anymore  I only went for a months after my Combat Action in Columbia  when was the  really happy about 3 weeks ago  can you tell me about that  it was on payday  didn't have very many positive role models of very few especially in my childhood I had a lot of negative examples on what not to be  so positive role models are probably say most of my superiors in the military that was my biggest growth experience in my life  how'd your best friend  as his big brother the guy who taught him everything my best friend feels that  I

659,male,1,16,1,55.0,659,now I'm going to pull up over to human yoga to see what she looks like I'm going to go ahead and start the camera recording up here hi Allie  I'm not a therapist  and please feel  are you okay with this yes  okay  so how are you doing today pretty well how about you  where are you from originally  play like about ale  well feel that I don't live in LA I live in Long Beach I like that there's  activity going on lot and a lot more people but generally I'm a small-town type of person  what are some things you don't really like a brother  crime  overcrowding cost of living  as much as I can  which one of your most memorable experiences  that's really hard to say I had a lot of good experiences in the military lot of good experiences in my marriage different traveling places camping raise children I was all good things  what you study  Human Services  all right now I am disabled and hopefully starting back to school in the fall  a dream job was to be a chemical dependency counselor  I just say it depends on the circumstances sometimes I can be quite withdrawn velvetizer iron would really outgoing I guess it just depends on this time  sometimes I'm in really deep thought or have something going on internally so I don't really say a lot I got more observant at that time then I think there's something that needs to be said I'm not I'm not afraid of saying it  tell me about your relationship with your family  I have a really good relationship with my family we all speak on the weekly basis I come from a large family have a lot of brothers and sisters my mother and father still living so I talked to them my mother lives not too far away from your father lives in the back  I got two older brothers that I talk to on a regular basis and my younger sisters that I talked to lots of nieces and nephews  sometimes when I'm feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it's not Hawaii but it's the best I've got  I listen to classical music  read something maybe watch a movie that's good that's a good Escape read something go to I'm involved with Alcoholics Anonymous I might go to a meeting that that helps me the interact with others  how are you at controlling  I rarely have an outburst it imma call him person my demeanor sometimes tells people otherwise but I'm really calm person that people say that I look mean but I'm not  when was the last time you argue with someone  that's really hard to say it's probably  just a disagreement with how somebody was being treated and I'm really that really bothers me when someone is being mistreated and I don't even really know that it really point it out but I know that's probably what it was about  the first thing that comes to mind is when my marriage broke up  I wish I would have just accepted it a lot sooner than I did and moved on with my life but it took what I had been I've been married for over 20 years and I was hard for me to accept to accept the fact that my wife wanted a divorce and I tried to hang in a lot longer than just got myself used and abused so I wish I would have just grabbed that situation and moved on a lot faster  what's something you feel guilty about  that's when my wife and I took our granddaughters and I promise to raise them and then see them through their upbringing that I didn't have the opportunity to do that by law that was my fault and I feel I feel guilty about that  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make  white goes back to acceptance of accepting my the end of my marriage that was that was the hardest decision was so when I finally just decided that to stop fighting the the  what was going to happen it and move forward  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory  I wouldn't ask say that probably wouldn't want to erase anything from my memory because I have grown and learned from every experience I've ever had in my life so I wouldn't say that I want to erase anything  that proved that load of thing that makes me who I am today  and I like me today  have you ever served in the military yes I have veteran of the United States Army  how old are you when you join the military was 19 years old  financially the idea of having a college money once I was very motivated to go to college having that money to to fund my college education was very  appetizing and also I felt like I needed a break from academics but I knew I wanted to start it up again at some point but that didn't happen you know life happened I got married and then another. I say I'm still trying to complete a college education now at age 47 so  almost 30 years ago on by but I'll get it  yes it's the best of the best experience best thing I've ever done for myself but joining the Army I still paying dividends it it's my living today's helps me pay my bills today my pension that I receive  taught me a lot I got to got to meet people from all over the country see places that I've never seen before getting a lot of opportunities  did you ever see combat no I did not  how easy was it for you  it's a little of this a bit of a struggle you know when you serve in your car after you get used to being regimented and having a place to be every day and then all of a sudden you're free basically in and you don't don't have that that discipline in your life anymore so it's it's hard to to readjust  I think it took me a long time longer than I realized  see I was a security guard I worked in the bakery at a Safeway store  that I install carpet and floor coverings  for about 10 years or better  working retail that's a lot of different jobs  all right  how did serving in the military change you  gave me a lot of self-confidence I was never a very athletic inclined but that's the most physical activity that ever had I develop my body  develop my mind show that much metal 42.

born in Oklahoma race here in Los Angeles South Bay District area Gardena Torrance Redondo Beach Hermosa Beach  Long Beach  well like I said I grew up here as a child  I like the people for the most  smog too much traffic  sometimes you feel like you're amazed cuz it La just keeps growing and growing and growing in the space is getting smaller and smaller and smaller  other than that though I don't have any problems with the Los Angeles I like the fish I'm right here by the coast so that's never a problem  that's my way of relieving stress I like to go fishing  you travel a lot no I pretty I'm pretty much a homebody I pretty much stay in the area I used to travel a lot  but I've gotten older I've become more of a I wouldn't say couch potato but I like to stick close to home  meeting people  thing thing for finding new places new restaurants new museums  well I used to when I get a 3-day weekend when I was younger I would just jump on my car throw my fishing tackle in the trunk and just take off I need to go from here to San Diego from here to the Oregon or whatever on a three-day weekend wouldn't tell anybody where I was I come back and everybody would be freaked out but I used to do just to get away from everything  play some eat a lot of interesting people  the trip I took the San Diego one time when I stayed at  what's the island over there where the Navy Seals train there's a big hotel over there and was in the middle of the week and was like I was the only one there on the beach really Pleasant  quality engineering mechanical engineering  I have an associate's

same thing quality manager for an aerospace machine shop here in Harbor  I'm qualified as both quality manager and quality engineering fo I pretty much handle both  my dream job  I've been retired be able to go fishing every day to just kidding  actually I am in my dream job I've always pictured myself having my own office being in charge of what it is I do  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing I can go both ways on that  sometimes I'm I'm standoffish shy but for the most part I'm not going  well I guess this is just the way I am I guess  there goes along with  I have three children are drawn one of them is a doctor she's a biologist she lives in Colorado two of them live in Arkansas I'm divorced for so many years I keep in contact with my kids my parents are both deceased my grandparents a deceased my older sister just moved back  by the way we've been keeping in contact  oh I like to go fishing I like to watch a good movie  an entertaining movie hello the guys where I live I like to watch like TruTV cops things like that because you face it every day  out on the street or on the bus or driving wherever  or wherever you might go in any anywhere now but pretty much just relax  being able to focus on something it'll take your mind off other things that might you might be having a problem with her might be stressing you out that work for instance  how are you  very efficient I like to think things through before I  I get angry at anyting  and  it's not that I get angry at I don't get angry at idiosyncrasies that type of situation or people's habits or anything it's  I got angry at a lot of society I see things popping popping up popping up in society that seem to be going towards the out-of-control direction is opposed to the getting things under control and  but now I'm pretty good at managing my anger in my  how would you say my reaction reactions  two different situations  let me think something I can't really think of anything significant  tell me about a situation that you wish you were  okay  give you an incident  a couple weeks ago  no being a hoe something I feel guilty about  picked up my mother was spent the last four years of her life and a sub Acute Care Center here at to Little Company of Mary from diabetes and stroke to pick my dad up  every morning drop him off in an hour or so with my mother and then go on to work and then after work I pick him up and come to drop him off and then I'd go back all the night she passed away  I picked him up and dropped him off and then I had to go home for a little while and I was going to go back that night and I fell asleep on the couch  I like lean I know it's like  the hardest decision  all right back to think about that  that situation that I just explained about the night my mother passed away at falling asleep and when I got back up that this morning to go pick up my daddy said your mother passed away last night  what made it really difficult and she was by her Capel mental capabilities were were completely there she or cognitive awareness everything she knew what was going on but her body just gave out  and nobody  yes I was in United States Coast Guard for 6 years  I spent four years at coast guard air rescue  and my last 18 months was right here in  Chronicles  when it was here I think it's in Florida now  is actually pretty good Duty I made rate really quick I just spent a couple days in the brig here and there but I got out with my fully five status  that's one of the big that's really the only true regret I have is I should have stayed in and and been retired by now  17  I had to  well I'll my grandfather pulled some strings and got me an appointment  for a needle Academy and but my physical exam worse me out of that my exam because of bad depth perception and it kind of wanted me to come in just as the general duty officer but I wanted to be a pilot that's a No-No No-No and I backed out of the whole thing and your later  I thought about it and go would like to still get drafted  oh yes it was definitely a better choice that put me through my school my education and Ladder years  taught me quite a bit of discipline  levels of self-esteem  did you ever speak  not as such we arrested a few people on drug bust in that type of thing back in the 70s  but not combat for saying not not armed combat  most of it  it was great cuz the last like I said the last 18 months was right here in  and I live  Los Angeles Los Angeles County so it was basically a 9 to 5 job to me  so I had no problem going back in the transition anyway what were the six years that I was in the service I saved a lot of money u.s. savings bonds of course so I saved enough money to be able to relax for a couple years to decide what I really wanted to do and that's when I decided to go back to college get a couple degrees saying manufacturing mechanical engineering quality engineering and I've been doing that  79  it's been pretty productive productive  I pride myself and the knowledge and experience I picked up over the years  to do after the military  machinist machinist engineering  quality control quality assurance  it's been  quite a lot it made me realize I had a future instead of just when I was younger you know just kicking around thinking you were going to live forever and not really focusing on anything for the future  you got the military has been a very good benefits touch with the GI bills  back then like I said it paid for your education so I had that option and I took that option  you're sorry to hear that but I took the option to use the GI bill for my education  fire during their I'm going through some side effects with my new inhalers I have a COPD bronchitis chronic bronchitis and they've been giving me some dizzy spells and coughing spells in the morning when I get up and have to take these inhalers and it really it exhaust you it takes a lot out of you  but I'm getting up there and unfortunately I'm still smoking on the lighter side of that I'm not as smoking as much as I used to  but other than that I'm doing pretty good I'll be moving out of US Vets in a couple of months and I need to pick up with the pace on that to find an apartment  have you noticed any change  no I'm still focused it before work focused on getting into a permanent residence  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  usually it's usually it's pretty easy I have those times when I'm tired to the point of where it's hard to fall asleep and sometimes I can just go to sleep right away  how long does thinking of maybe something that happened during the day like you mentioned earlier in this conversation things I could have handled better things I could have done a little differently  what are you like  Trump fired  little grouchy I guess a little grouchy but a cup of coffee and I'm usually through it and over it  no  back before I go to the service I was diagnosed with what do they call it bipolarism  but I never really thought much about it  did you know you get up when you get down  last Saturday when I went to go deep sea fishing  got a really nice red snapper that was about that be  where was what With Friends  my grandfather  Oasis spend a lot of time with him on summer vacations when I was a teenager  my dad was in his retired army so he was away so I guess my grandfather was more of my my father's been the male figure in my in my life  he passed away 1972 no 1970  21 * 2 * 3 * 72 and was 1972  best friend  easy going  fishing  what are you most proud of  my children  I have three kids three children $2 to $2 one son I'm really proud of my oldest daughter I was able back in 1986 I came into a significant amount of money to be able to put them all through college if they wanted and my oldest daughter took me up on it  she graduated  she's doing her internship there is a doctorate in biology  I think I've asked  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me you're very welcome I feel like I'm in an episode of The Matrix  you need some pictures on the back  goodbye  you know the first thing I thought of when I said I didn't realize she was sitting there in that chair was The Matrix
669,male,0,7,1,,669,"I just say I don't feel like I'm not  I'm ready to rock and roll  are we on camera  is it a she or he  oh there she has where's your face we're not going to see your face wow  her seen this before  so once again I ministered her up and then went to after she's done she'll tell you the environment  pretty cool  I'm not a therapist but I'm here  and please  I'm fine  oh I'm feeling pretty good I had a little I was a little bit  I wasn't sure what to expect when I got here but I feel pretty comfortable now  I feel fine  I'm very upbeat and in a good mood and happy  Feeling Good  great  where are you from originally I'm from New Jersey born and raised in New Jersey  went to basic training in New Jersey at Fort Dix drafted into the army when I was 17  well  I don't like it's just too crowded in La there's just too many people and it's just everybody to rush rush and  I like a little more slow-paced  but I do like the weather here so that's where I'm here and my family is here  that's what brought me here  do you travel a lot  I traveled when I was younger when I got out of the military because I wasn't sure exactly what I was  looking to do with my life and but now I'm kind of settled in and going to school for culinary arts  in Hollywood and I have a fiance who graduated from USC and I'm pretty happy with my life  but traveling not too much anymore now  what do you enjoy about  going to new places and meeting new people and seeing other parts of the country I haven't been to Europe but I hope to get there someday  especially about it  for credit number years I lived in Louis in New Orleans Louisiana took a trip there  and enjoyed the food was fantastic and the music was fantastic and the weather was great  and I loved it there  and I took a truck back taking a trip to Las Vegas  because I used to be a gambler at one time but  not anymore  that's about it  I'd rather not talk about that  well I'm currently enrolled in a culinary arts school  but I got my GED in the military  and so now I'm taking a culinary arts to be a chef  I hope to open up a restaurant someday  I'm going to school I'm going to school in  and I work part-time  my dream job is to own a bed and breakfast with my fiance that's my dream job  and I hope to make that come true within the next year or two  do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  probably more shy than not going I was much I was very shy when I was growing up but I'm still shy but I'm trying to break out of my shell so to speak  well my mom and dad are no longer with us they passed on  and I have a sister in Northern California  we were never close so we don't communicate very much and  which is probably partially my fault parsley her fault we just don't seem to have a lot in common to show  my mom passed away and that was pretty rough she was pretty sick by dad passed away about 9 years ago from Alzheimer's so  we had a good relationship.  to relax I just like to go take walks take long walks on the beach  read a book  watch live sports on TV  I love the outdoors so I love to get out and exercise whenever I can that's what I do  how are you  very good very good  very good  I don't have a temper I don't get mad very out it takes a lot for me to get very very mad at somebody I'm cutting easygoing guy  no  no not really and I I try to avoid trouble whenever I can sometimes you can't avoid it but I try  I'm fine  probably arguing about with my roommate about making too much noise when he gets up in the morning and you know silly things like that but  when you live in that kind of environment you have to learn to live with other people and  it's kind of rough but you do the best you can  I like you. I don't really want to discuss that later would rather not I'd rather avoid that question  all right  what's something you feel guilty about  probably  not getting enough education when I was younger and I had problems in school and  running away from home when  disappointing my family things like that I had a bad childhood due to my fault though she not theirs but I made the wrong decision which I'm paying for now so  but we have to move ahead  the hardest decision I had to make was  putting my mom to rest  thought that was the hardest and it's been about 2 years now but  I'm still not over that one so that was the hardest  she was my best friend so  now she's gone  my early years before I went into the military I didn't have many friends I was very shy very bad in school I wish I would have paid more attention  I probably in better better position now but  it's too late to worry about that now so we have to move on  and with the acquisition support and help with my fiance that's what I'm doing  have you ever served in the middle  yes I was in the Army in Vietnam back in the day when I was 17  how is your food service worker in the military  many years ago  17 I was drafted  19  7 / 70 or 71 I can remember it's been a long time  I was drafted I didn't have a choice and really so  how was drafted  so I went in the army  which was a good experience actually  yes I am  yeah and now I'm getting help from the military so that's a good thing  no I was Stateside all the time I was in the military I was stationed in New Jersey  Georgia Texas  that's right I'm respected Fort Hood Texas  it was well do the fact that I didn't go overseas or she combat it was fairly easy you know it was hard leaving home at that young age but it was fairly easy I didn't have much, I had some problems in the military but  I missed him a lot and miss my family but it was okay it was a good experience I'm glad I did it  that's when I started traveling traveling a lot because I didn't know  are we still young and I wanted to see the country and travel around work here work there good job you got a job there just thought I should have been going to the school and while I was young and getting it having a decent job now instead of starting at the age of 60 but they say it's never too late so here I am  I'll be okay I'll be alright  well it turned me into a man that's for sure  yeah and maybe become no more responsible  learn to take learn to be on my own  well I have my good days and bad days because I'm on this new medication for depression so some days I don't feel good and  I have other medical issues I have breathing problems and I have  some other medical issues but most of the time I feel pretty good but there are they there are good days and bad days  I just take it one day at a time  have you noticed any changes  well I just know I don't sleep well matter fact I hardly sleep at all which is not good  and then like I say I have my depressing days and days where I just don't have any energy and don't feel like doing anything and then  I have my good days with my fiance to go to the best because she's my  pride and joy  without her I don't know where I'd be  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep very difficult very difficult about 3 to 4 hours a night last night I woke up at about 3 in the morning and I never could go back to sleep  that's not good but yeah my sleeping is very bad  it seems to get worse and worse everyday  I'm not quite sure how I guess just I don't have the answer to that question I don't know  never used to be that way  all right I don't know  well  I have no energy and I get grouchy I'm very restless  tired of course because I haven't slept  I do the best I can  have you ever been diagnosed  I'm not sure what that is I don't know what that is  well I don't know what that is I was never diagnosed with anything but you know they want to put me on some sleeping pills but I try and stay away from as much pills as I can I really don't like to take a lot of medications but there's some medications I have to take  such as I have medications for my anxiety and my depression things like that I have to have those but other than that I'd rather stay away from medications if possible  well I have the I have anxiety  attacks that I've had for the last three or four years would you put me in the hospital but as long as I stay up on my medication I'm okay but I have stomach problems  I'm just other issues  so it's just a day-to-day thing I deal with it the best I can  I don't know I'm not an I really don't know I just like I started do some  problems when I was losing my I thought I was losing my eyesight because I had my iPod with popping out to do a thyroid problem I had and so they put me on this medication that I can't get off of now I've been on it for about 4 years 5 years and I'll probably out the rest of my life I have to take it twice a day or I will end up in the emergency room which I have before  but I'm okay  all right  how do you cope with them  I just try and I just deal with it the best I can go out and  take a walker  engaging some physical activities you know go to the beach like I said before and things like that keep my mind occupied  how's the best way  okay  well because I wasn't sure what was wrong with me and I was just because I was feeling sick every day  which is not natural so I had to go see a doctor psychiatrist not because I'm crazy just because I needed some help some medication and they gave me this medication that they did tell me that it was addictive  and it's highly addictive and I've been on it for like I said about four years now and I'll probably be out of the rest of my life so but it keeps me  feeling okay  I can deal with things  well I have an appointment tomorrow is a psychiatrist and yes I do  not that often as long as I keep on my medication I'm okay  do you feel therapy is useful  well the last time I was in therapy with the psychiatrist all they did was  it wasn't very much of a help because they were talking to me about my family and things like that and they weren't really helping me any so  I don't go to therapy that often it's not a regular thing  I just go to see a psychiatrist and that was the first time I've gone and it just all session lasted about 10 minutes how's your family where they live blah blah blah blah blah blah  nothing about me and my problems and I never went back so I do have an appointment tomorrow with a different psychiatrist to see if I can get some more help and because I find Working is very hard because of my problems with my stomach and my breathing and if so I'm trying to  hopefully get on some disability you know I'm 60 years old and  finding a job especially in these times is not that easy so we'll see what happens  because I don't I need it I need some income you know and I can't be little bit too young to retire so I need to be put on disability  so hopefully I get some help  none actually none  sad to say but it's true  like I said I don't go on a regular basis so it's been a while I will see what happens tomorrow  when was the last  I feel pretty happy right now  and we want I want to wish my fiance I'm always happy because she's a very puppy positive person and we're in love and  nothing like being in love  so that's what I'm most happy when I'm with her because we have a lot in common and we have fun together  I love her  she's very supportive  yes she has been for the last 3 years  well I met her when she she's a paralegal and I met her during the time when my mom passed away and she was worth for the attorney that was helping us with the selling of the house Friday of the money in this and that we kind of went out for a cup of coffee and we started to  enjoy each other's company  friendly dependable and reliable  well is my 60th birthday the other day  and show me my fiance made me a nice dinner and we spent the weekend together and we went to the beach and  we just had a good old time sitting in the backyard  barbecuing  enjoying ourselves  that was great  yeah I was right  well that I'm 60 years old and still have a full head of hair and still fairly healthy and  about to be married  that's what I'm most proud of right now  found somebody to love me and somebody that I love  that's great  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you  goodbye"

You know if I can get myself out there I do a little exercise  that's really not to relax that's really to unwind and get myself out of the tension that I might be in  probably 10 minutes ago non-verbal  tell me about a situation that you wish you would  marriage  did not  do all of my options before I chose and it was a bad decision  I love them but they didn't love me be careful of that  what's something you feel guilty about  not being more available to my son  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had  wow that's a tough for me I've been following the hardest decision  oh there was no decision in this this is but something that I'd like to relate erased from my memory was in that accident with my brother a long time ago  I wish that had never happened to him  have you ever seen  yes  18 baby didn't think so at the time though  I just wanted to do something and that's what I did  are you happy  yes  not at first but in hindsight looking back yes  did you ever think  in a manner of speaking I was in Korea when they stomped one of my Majors to death and from that point forward everywhere we went we went fully loaded meaning armed with ammunition  no actual engagement With the Enemy though  or what other personality or whatever you call it  how is the weather  very  I never left it I was there as a worker  and just really was a pretty much the same as just changing jobs now  to do after the military  went back to the job that I had before when I was working with the u.s. steel  what is serving in the military change you  don't know if it did  if it did I have to say that gave me a  appreciation or the opportunity to work with stuff that I never probably would have worked with him so I travel a little bit around the world and we're working on the Korea and that may be more aware and appreciative of all of the things that are out there I got a chance to see him and touch him a little bit  how have you been feeling lately  depressed  no but I'll try to I  living environment where people are insecure so homeless and environment and there's a lot of stress that goes along with that if you're trying to do something that's a lot of you know you're beautiful you don't you're not sitting with the other people because the downtrodden and  that makes it stressful  yes  can you tell me about that  depression and frustration  with basically almost everybody that I've tried to confide in  turned out to be treacherous and just not trustworthy or dedicated  recently  the same size if I get a lot of sleep in my own opinion but I think probably less focused  less able to focus but not getting sleep lately has been tough or go to sleep okay but I just wake up in a few hours then back to sleep you probably a lot of other things too  okay  have you ever been diagnosed with p  no  yeah that was one of the questions on there but it is it needs clarification and that's why I checked know on that yes but it was I was part of an experiment with taking interferon and ribavirin to try to cure hepatitis and those those two drugs cause depression so I was chemically depressed as opposed to clinically and as a difference so there was some the psychiatric help and some medication to help me get beyond that 311 months of treatment with that it was tough don't recommend it to anybody interferon is a killer don't do it  that treatment ended probably and all of the symptoms with it probably 3 to 5 years ago 3 years ago I think  nightmare has intense itching  thoughts of suicide and Vivid terrifying nightmares  that's interferon  interferon and ribavirin to drugs that they used to treat cancer and also in the treatment of hepatitis-c currently  in addition to a third drug that they used can't think of the name of it  how do you cope with them  well I seem to be okay now has skin damage my body broke out in a full-body rash  cause intense itching full full Ian golf the body for intense itching  almost made me jump out of window but I held on  the itching we're talkin about chemical cause being chemically induced as opposed to psychologically  okay  you still go to therapy now no  do you feel therapy  most worthless piece of crap I have a 20 out of 10 therapist that I talk to whoever said that the VA maybe to actually knew what they were doing or and then two were sincerely concerned about what they were doing the rest was just collecting a paycheck  show me more about that  well they were incompetent just asking foolish questions why I'm even we were supposed to be talking about some of my personal things in life and she was playing little games like sitting a person purposely leave the person on the table to see your nose still use using Psychology 101 the book bad about through the by the Numbers at the way that she was taught to proceed with someone as opposed to actually knowing how to proceed with someone if they just it was it was it was a funny actually actually funny  sad  that is over but the changes since going to therapy  nothing you know all of that depression stuff kind of eased off and so I'm back to trying to do the things that I was doing before I took that 11 months to go in that experiment  okay  when is the  in a long time  I usually get a little bit of that daily somewhere I get a little bit of happiness in here  just a little just enough to keep me saying I think  there are elected without being you know listing of the risk of being casciac my father but other than that of positive influence in my life have been many mostly the men that I worked with while working it was a younger man  there was some of the best the best work experience I've had in my experience is my 30 or 40 years of working with the team and ship those men and it was probably the same kinship that you would gain from being in combat because it was dangerous work and these guys looked out for each other they took care of each other I'm pretty sure it's pretty much the same way for a guy that experienced combat and the camaraderie that they had to have with each other because their lives were on the line  how do your best friend  giving  kind  nice  but I really enjoyed I get a lot of those could be going too many things I enjoy the moment you know driving  shopping for an enjoyment in something some kind of way everything I do  want to see my son  but many accomplishments most proud of in my life  been honest  you're welcome thank you  yes  you guys have a you guys have a ton of money for"

Just  what it is but I'm always wondering what the next person is going to do when they get that close to me like especially you think in a crowded room where you can't move around as much and you know I'm always watching the whole everything trying to see who's going to do what and when  usually I try and get away from the crowd you know that's how I cope with them that I usually just trying to get away from the crowd not focus so much on it but it ain't hard specially if you got to be there but yeah I just kind of stay to myself and watch everything moving  okay  A friend of mine who I used to serve in the Navy with he told me  I should go  I should go and actually check out what's going on with my back but when I got in there I start talking to the first place I went was the mental health ward and told him what was going on with me, attitudes in my harmful thoughts to other people and that's what got me here but I got to say a friend of mine suggested that I go  yeah yes I do well my last therapy session was about a week or two ago but I'm getting scheduled to go back  into therapy  yeah yeah yeah it's it's slow me down you know I'm not so quick to want to hurt nobody no more I'm not so while still defensive but  I don't look at it is I want to go and you'll saying  put do physical harm the young saying certain people just for being around  three more about what we want to hurt people  it's a weird feeling I don't know how to describe it it's kind of like describing the taste of milk to somebody it's just anybody I'll be walking in the hallway and a minute I'm looking at them I'm figuring  what kind of if I had to encounter that person how would I physically disabled them you know do you know the saying don't show come out do I just strike him in the throat poker I don't say break a leg or arm or something you'll just how can I incapacitate this person  it's a trip I'm telling you the alternative just had a thought all the time with a complete stranger who really doesn't pose a threat to you is true  so  I'm a little more tolerant I don't fly off the handle as much as I used to you know stuff that used to piss me off like you don't say little things I don't really get too upset about a may have sent me but  my reactions of different I don't like I said I don't explode cuz everything I mean the smallest thing with send me mail saying over the top but not so much no more you know it's kind of breathing take it in stride or try to you know  so yeah it's just it's working it helps  oh man really happy  oh my God  may all that has been some years it's been some years I can't even really put a finger on what I actually felt really happy  so you know cuz it's always been I might have moments where you don't say everything's cool and it's a good day or whatever but  I'm still throughout the day there's they'll still Bostwick creep in and you know I'm saying I'm looking at people this that another thing I'm saying this way and nut so yeah it's been awful long time since I was just genuinely really happy  great  is it all right if you say so  who's the real life  somebody's been a positive influence in my life my parents you although we have a problems you know I look up to them they've been through with each other for umpteen years and a positive influence to me I mean outside of that there's a old girlfriend of mine named it don't matter who what name is old girlfriend of mine she's  kind of show me how to take life as it comes and you'll not everything's a battle because she's going through stuff that I'll never have to go through you know saying she's terminally ill but yet she still has a smile on her face and you know just keeps it going so I got to take a  a page out of her book with that one you know everything's

708,male,0,0,0,19.0,708,"Minister for camcorder recording when I reach the human from  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  are you okay with this sure glad  okay  so how are you doing today  I'm good Ellie how are you  I'm Pasadena  hi the weather I love the weather I love the people there so many things to do in LA I love La you know it's my home and I wouldn't live anywhere else  traffic the traffic that's probably the biggest thing is getting a little crowded  that's it  when I was in the military at job with a lot I haven't traveled too much in the past few years but I'm looking forward to doing some more traveling soon  what do you enjoy about  eating eating new foods eating different type of foods depending on where I go maybe the nightlife clubs and stuff like that  and just going somewhere new you know cuz culturally I appreciate differences so  I'd like to hear about what  one of my trips Japan you know when I got to Japan only stayed for 6 months but  you start to learn more about yourself I learn more about myself as an American by going overseas and understanding that  just because I'm American and I'm from this country this is not the only country in the world in millions of people billions of people actually live a lot different from my dude from we do and just learning to appreciate the differences you know  and appreciate myself to  but the trip itself you know actually 6 months is not long enough I think where you go to a foreign country for me because at the six-month Point that's exactly when I started to I really wanted to just wanted to stay but it was time to come back so then again like I said traveling food Customs just learning more about other cultures and it's real exciting this it's it's not to mention educational but  I think it's needed I think a lot of Americans are a lot of my family members would never been able to go out of the country need a trip somewhere you know I don't know if America to really understand their place in the world  I will probably actually flying to Japan in flying over Alaska the mountain tops in Alaska I need the mountain ranges are so huge and they were all covered with snow but it look like we were close enough to actually put our hands out of the plane and touch the top of us you know snow capped mountains I thought that was really exciting  what you study at school I was a criminal justice major  now I work in the medical field actually  dream job and actors being an actor that would be a dream job  I'll going  tell me about your relationship with your family  well I have one brother and two sisters I'm close to my younger sister she just had the first grandchild in the group of my siblings you know a couple of years ago so I haven't had a few she lives in Oregon my other sister lives here in the LA area my brother lives in Oakland I would like to visit I would like for us to all be together you know more than we are but we're not so we do the best we can but the relationship is pretty strong my mom she lives down in San Diego and I try to talk to her at least once a week and get to go down and see her every every now and then my father passed away in 04  and for the extended family will usually get together on holidays Manny Thanksgiving Christmas and keep in contact like everybody else now on Facebook  sometimes when I'm feeling  I turn on  I'll go to the gym go to the gym or maybe you know sometimes now as I'm getting older I realize when I take a nap that kind of helps me to relax wake up refreshed and ready to go  how are you in control  I'm pretty good at controlling my temper you know like everyone else I have I've got pet peeves and if it's one of the peeves that might tend to get a little angrier than some of the other things that you note in the bother me but overall I control my ankle pretty well  when was the  the last argument  wow I don't remember  situation that I would have handled differently  I've seen I had a laptop and that I was over a acquaintance home and my laptop disappeared  and I didn't get angrier and you know I didn't I was just really too, nonchalant about the whole incident and as I look back on it I should have probably be and should have been more assertive about them finding my laptop for you know finding out what happened and I kind of just let that go and  didn't say much  that's something you feel guilty about  I feel guilty about not working out  as often as I see it  the hardest decision I ever had to make  I haven't had any hard decisions I'm hard decisions  staying in LA and not moving back to Philadelphia that was a hard decision you know I lived in Philadelphia for a couple years and I moved back home but I wanted to move back but I did and I stayed here you know that was a hard decision  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from  probably the abuse my father exhibited towards my mother as a child  yes  18  by the members of my family has been in the military and I don't think I was ready for college at that point so I actually sign the papers when I was 17 for the delayed entry program and winning after graduation  are you happy  yes extremely  did you ever see cow  no combat no  how easy was it for you  made the transition was  more difficult than I anticipated it was strange even though I had been in the military for those years and I had really become a different type of person and it took a little while but it happens they have a thing called separation for about the last two months before you're discharged where I kind of helps you get ready or prepared you back to get into civilian life so it takes a little while but it's it's it it happens it takes a while some people takes longer you know some people didn't take us long so  I went to school  how did serving in the military change you  it allowed me to mature I don't think I'm I don't know if I would have gotten that when I went to college right after high school or not but it allow me to also be on my own and kind of find out who I was and grow up so  how have you been feeling lately been feeling great you know I I don't have any worries or complaints  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately no  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty easy I'm a light sleeper but I sleep pretty well  what are you  grumpy  irritated easily not too Pleasant to be around  have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD no  yes  when was the last time  really happy well probably last week last Wednesday  my father  well I mean I think one of the things I got from my father was to always be positive and it in and the level determination is basically never give up on what you want to do  how do your best friend  as a good friend funny  caring giving  what's something you did  volunteering for a charity helping serve food to other individuals  nice  what are you most proud of  my track and field trophies  thanks for

712,male,0,0,0,21.0,712,so friggin I'm pleased  are you okay with this yes yes  done pretty good  how are you  Philadelphia Pennsylvania  the weather in Latin culture food  music the beaches  what's better dirty large parts of it getting violent stuff like that  GasBuddy  you travel a lot  I used to in the Marines and growing up I did y'all all over the east coast and around the country out  same thing different different types of people different types of food different types of music seeing different architecture and things like that the east coast and the west coast is very different in terms of how we build our buildings so just different places that you go you see different things like that  turkey we visited the oldest church in the world I believe it was called the oldest church in the world they have those the towers the towers and just a different people I ate goat and some other types of food that I had never eaten before  and I found out the people or are people just like us it's not just like Americans we might have our perception but people from another country they're just the same they just have a different language and they just look different but they don't they're not different you know  American Experience  I remember everything I have a very vivid memory I remember a lot of things  I don't know  I was a trumpet player since third grade and I did that in the mornings so I did that for 15 years of my life music  warehousing labor  can I ride my bike a lot  the Los Angeles Philharmonic go to the Boston Pops Orchestra or something like that something big  something like that to you  Lili outgoing I wish I when I was growing up but not anymore  the best of guy yes  I I have music I love all kinds of music so if I just put on my headphones that usually helps or I go for a bike ride I have my bike downstairs I'll just go as far as I feel like going 10 15 20 miles and then come home that's very relaxing  I don't have a temper I used to put it this way my daughter's mother had a temper and I started to learn it from her but I realize that's  but that's not me that that's not the type of person that I am and so I I  we separated and I've long since not been like that yeah  with her only with her never never like in public or with the police or anything like that I would say that she some girls know that they can use the police  they can just say things some girls not all girls and she would do that but no it was never I've never like hit a woman or anything like that no  when was the last  my former landlady I just moved about two months ago where I was before my my landlady was a drug addict she didn't didn't do anything except drug she didn't fix anything she was just lazy and everything was unkempt and and  if you are renting to somebody else I had strong views that you should keep up with the property and I which is build up over time and I told her you know I've been here and I've given you so much money so much money and you haven't done anything except drugs and it was we got a little heated  I I don't know because I think the way things end up  is the right way in the end if your Zone as you learn so  Google I said you have any regrets  I don't know I've learned I've learned you can't have regrets cuz y'all at the end of the day you end up in the right place and that's what you have to look at so I don't think so I've learned from the things that I may have  but I had to learn to understand I'm sure you do  I might as well be honest I know it's looking at it I know you're a person on the other side of that but you don't look like a person but I had a woman that I was chasing and I we were intimate we were together and we were intimate and I shouldn't you know made me promise not to tell anybody at work and I was so excited and I told somebody cuz I thought I could trust that person and  I couldn't trust that person and word got out in the hole Restaurant New and she was embarrassed and I broke her trust it was a pretty it was pretty bad but at the same time and again I said that I don't regret things because she admitted she admitted that it hurt and by admitting it heard it kind of said more  about the situation if somebody could admit to you that you can hurt them that means they're vulnerable to which said something you know I understand that so I learned something more than maybe had I not done it had I not heard I might not have known  tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to  probably coming to California my daughter's mother and I like I said we didn't get along and I have a 9 year old daughter who I love and I want the best for so so five years ago she moved out the mother moved out here to meet her new husband and and start a new life and all that and she brought my daughter along and it took me a couple months to get money and everything together for me to do it but I knew when I came out here that I didn't know anybody we're from the East Coast I didn't know anybody I didn't know nothing about California I looked at a map and I said Santa Monica I know that City I'll try to get close to there and when it came time for it like the few days before and I knew I bought a bus ticket and I packed as much as I could and I knew that I was moving to the other side of the country  and then I couldn't turn around that that they missed a huge step it was a huge step and I knew why I was doing it but I was terrified I was 10 I got here and I'm still terrified and it took some time to try to get everything together you know to eventually live with a drug addict that I was with but  for sure getting up and moving and leaving everything and friends that I knew and starting completely brand new that was that was very difficult  a lot of my childhood my parents were abusive and I guess this anonymity thing helps but yeah my parents were my parents were destructive and there's a lot of things that they did to me as a child that that I wouldn't wish on other kids  I  I've learned that I'm a stronger person but I  I still wouldn't wish it on somebody else come stronger and I can help other people because of the things I know but but it doesn't completely justify the stuff that happened to you  yes the Marines  19  I was actually going to go to college for music for trumpet and my parents didn't help me with any of the decisions and I didn't know how I was going to get there and  I was so adamant about still playing though  so I don't know I knew the Marines were something that I could do it would be physical but I could still keep playing and it wasn't going to be so  like my parents wouldn't have driven me to college running like that and I had no idea how I was going to make that step I think I fell to the military  was going to be an easier step so to speak I don't know if that makes sense but yeah it was more streamlined just to get in the military and keep playing that way  are you happy  yeah I would say I learned a lot from from my experiences  you have no regrets you know what I mean I can definitely say that as a marine having been a marine there's nothing that can break me and I learned that for sure for the military  all right  did you ever see combat no thank God  how is the weather  not easy I would I would say that I right  how do I join  I went to college and pursue that path things would be considerably different  yeah the military and one thing they don't tell you they think the whole thing about the GI bill that don't help pay for college but that's for like vocational schools and stuff like that you don't really know that and I'm not a vocational school guy  the jobs are quite the same you kind of a little bit older and you already missed that early Windows to get in on a good career  so a lot of people don't don't end up where they might have intended to be before they join the military put it that way  to do after the military  bunch of jobs different jobs telemarketing pizza delivery old phones for Verizon Wireless warehousing of done thanks and of course traveled for my daughter  how did serving in the military change you  what's the weather like I said no matter what comes on no matter what comes my way I know I I'll be okay and especially physically but just endurance mental endurance after sleeping in the dirt and and waking up in freezing sleeping bags and digging holes and and and sweating to no end and Twenty Mile and stuff like that  life no matter how hard it gets it's still a piece of cake for me most people wouldn't say that  how have you been feeling lately  a little bit stressed I'm getting older on 35 and  City harder to find a better job there's a lot of good in the workforce is not that that you know that this whole thing with the economy it's not as good as they try to paint it in the news there are lots and lots of people looking for jobs in a lot of them don't pay enough and a lot of them don't give enough hours and it's  I think the economy is a big Downer for for a lot of people  no no no I'm pretty good  I said I'm getting a little bit better actually  like I said I just I just learned to persevere no matter how hard it gets I'll be okay I'll be alright  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty good I do sleep well  most most nights  obviously still pretty good I may be a little bit a tad bit sluggish but if I don't sleep for the night the next night I'll sleep fine and  let me see all right still  have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD  oh no you biting me now  have you been diagnosed with  no  when was the last time  2 days ago a friend of mine  when we fix our bikes we have to mountain bike so we got them both fixed we had a good hour or so very good high-minded conversation two things that that I understand that he wants to understand  we went for a ride afterwards which always makes me feel good so yeah 2 days ago  it was good  mostly authors and musicians  Paulo Coelho  Radiohead sound like that  how would your best friend describe  intelligent articulate  he said something about he said  the reason I talk to you because I need to know so much  something like that but yeah cuz I know a lot  most times has riding my bike I just now took roughly and I like to just see if I can do that how how hard and we hadn't ridden I had with my bike in like two months so I was curious what it was going to feel like for my legs endurance and all that and as I'm writing and I got it in the best gear and I'm just cranking along on the road now you know on the freeway whatever that feels great that's accomplishment that's physical you know I'm building myself I like doing that  nice  yes  still funny picture  I know you're a real person on the other side of that but you don't look like a real person that's a shame  but they tried  having endured my childhood and all that and come out the other side and not be not be violent and not be abusive to learn from those things a lot of people get stuck  I know it and I didn't I learn to turn that around  very good  thank you  goodbye  Target  sure  no I'm not right and not life but we

Of time and I had no let him go tell him that you know you stopped you to go you have to man up and do what you have to do for yourself  okay  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from me  although whole lot of things I wish I could erase my memory  one thing I  Sam being whipped for the extension cord the website on my body and  a tattoo on my left forearm  that's going to be there in until I die or have it removed  man it is show so it's got to be there  have you ever served in the military yes  yes I have  19  I grew up yes yes I'm happy I did I had grew up and become you know a young man it was time for me to get out and start making my own way for myself  did you ever see  no no I just got in at the end of the Vietnam War which I try to go in while I was still happening but I was too young and it will let me go in  how easy was it for you to go  I really didn't have that much of a problem adjusting to it but I really missed being in the military you know as far as being an active-duty I wish I would have stayed in there instead of coming back  home so quick  you know but Bobby being married I came back to my wife and  my marriage didn't last long song  and miss me up  so I just had to spin the wheels for a while  went to work  I worked at the Naval Shipyard I worked as a mechanic and I work doing construction work  and also Parks and Recreation  what a gave me a different outlook on life  as far as the things that I was doing as a Young Man  I just turn me just completely around backwards go to the way you know do things right in my life instead of what I was doing hanging out in the streets drinking  no way my friends and stuff like that so that was a really big help for me  living life on life's terms if that's a good enough answer living life on life's terms trying to make it day by day and stay out of the way  stay out of Harm's Way  not really  not that I can think of right off the top of my head no  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  sometimes it varies I'm a getting old  three door four nights okay and then other nights I'm up and anxious waiting to go and do what I have to do the following day and and sometimes I just don't sleep I had to get up and watch television drink coffee and smoke cigarettes and think  isomalt  it's some form but I didn't follow through with it you know you want to give me all the different medications and things like that I took some of her then I stop cuz you're putting me in a whole different different atmosphere  and I didn't know what brand I have left I want to keep it and use it  probably like five years but more of an event like that last year pass  same different psychiatrist  guess more of  more of depression and my surroundings  the area that I was living in  play a big part of that  well when you live around people that you know are in gangs and stuff and shooting shooting up and down the street all the time and you see four five six people get killed within a 3-mile. On your street I mean that's it is heartbreaking your your heart goes out to them people  you know when you see these people go up and down the street every day and you don't know who's who and what's what so some you have to live with me have to be on your guard at all times  how do you cope with them  passing by  wave keep going about your business  can you tell me about that  well I really don't have her answer for because a lot of times you don't conversate with those type of people you just Pastor buys  see, because I was  had got depressed and start using alcohol and drugs  and you know what to change my environment and also changed myself so I needed to take myself out of that situation and put myself in a different environment and start over again  you still go to therapy now  I know I don't know I haven't been I haven't been to therapy since  April of this year  and that was in a group setting  yes it is  if you use the materials are the tools that they give you say it's very useful  well Frances if somebody give you some advice  to not do it a certain thing  and you do that certain thing was said I warned you not to do that then you're going to kick your own self in the behind so it'd be better if you  take the advice and not do that thing and you are you know the results and a lot of times you have traveled down that road before it's no good for you so dad in  well been utilizing some of the material that they've given me  and I'll set up keep going on the roller coaster ride and I'll just leave that little part of life alone and live life on life's terms  okay  when is the last time  wow it's been a long long time since I  really really felt happy it's been a long time I couldn't answer that question for you  I mean  I couldn't Odysseus spend years  for me repeat the question  my sister is a positive influence in my life my older sister is she's a  a real inspiration to me  I appreciate it  how do your best  I guess you could describe me as a moderate metal type person  I went bought me a new pair of shoes  data put in my storage  I don't rain to where I am  when I get a chance to  nice  what are you most proud of  well started school I'm happy about that  I could be a big change it is going to help me down the line and I know it is so I'm looking forward to that  big changes this is going to be very helpful in my future  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me you're welcome  bye  I said goodbye  okay"
716,male,1,15,1,73.0,716,not very typical to that happen but just in case I kind of have to give you a warning so that you don't sit in here can I go in what's going on so it fits yeah I'd say 30 seconds or more  for real  I'm going to go ahead and start her up okay  I'm not a therapist  and please  okay  how are you doing today all right  Inland Empire  just got here I'm not too sure good buildings  there's a lot of people are obnoxious  getting around kind of a headache but it's alright buses are pretty good  you travel a lot yes  pain away  different sceneries  different places different people  well  going to North Carolina  man to do with military  but none recently  I don't think I have one not anymore  I guess going overseas  studying solar panel technology in currently studying right now  student  on my own business and what I don't know yet  but something looking for myself  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  both  it's not good right now I don't really talk to him  certain situations came up I don't really talk to him  sometimes when I'm feeling 10  I know it's not Hawaii  gym I go to the gym let us tension  stress anything that I can possibly do one thing I know going to the gym  the only thing I really got right now that relieves anything that I have  not sure  I can control it at times  sometimes it'll get out of control  my girlfriend we are getting pretty good. It was about why I don't call her enough and when I wasn't calling her enough  you got pretty bad  there's a lot of them  what's something you feel guilty about  guilty  there's nothing to feel guilty about  a lot of them I don't even talk about but being close to my family is one of the things that I never did and I and I and I regret that  tell me about the hardest decision ever had  I said there was a lot of decision hard decision that I made but I never made them  I can say what you can say I took the easy way out maybe  tell me about Nevada  don't know  have you ever  yes  alright then again not good  it's hard to explain  don't know how to even start it  UPS down depression  dealing with going back to school money  I hit you can say I hit rock bottom and I'm starting my life over again  yeah that's because of no longer doing things that I ain't supposed to do  but it's hard  can you tell me about that  well from a previous addict  why do I get to that I don't know  I'm not even to share all I know is that I was just doing the wrong things at the wrong time got me to so much trouble  now I'm starting over cuz I lost everything  but I'm happy about how I'm starting now  it's slow but kind of like an adventure at the same time there's a lot of things that I'm thinking about as well a lot of things that I can't forget  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I can't I'm under sleep meds  two types and sometimes I can't even fall asleep it'll take I can't take more than I  I'm prescribed  but I have problems sleeping  why  I really don't know why  bad dreams  past events  thoughts to keep on popping up  bad mood depression  I'm not too sure  irritable on edge  you can say sometimes I'll be walking around back if I'm tense from worried about something  more less worried about falling asleep when I'm sleeping  I believe so yes just currently not too long ago  currently filing my claim  yes that's one thing I didn't been diagnosed with for sure  I don't like it I hate it I don't know if I can pull out of it  I don't even think the medication that I'm even using even helps  I'm still trying to get try different ones apparently there's enough out there that I can go through  maybe more than a year ago  about a year ago for my depression  isolation not really talking with anybody  I wouldn't really be so like a people person communication wasn't all time low  I will be mainly staying at the house I wouldn't be going out I wouldn't be doing events or doing the things that I would like to do  none of us was alone with my addiction as well  that's one thing I can't figure out is what the hell trigger though  why am I like this  why am I actually doing things or did the things that I do or did  coming in Natick  not communicating with my family  I wasn't I wasn't like this before  how do you cope with them  I don't know  the only thing I got on my side of the gym it's the one place that I know I can release a lot of tension  that one place where I know I don't have to talk to people but we're all together they're doing the same thing we're all doing the same thing and exercising and getting physically well  the only place where I know that I can relax  certain events that took place  I lost certain loved ones  I lost certain relation lost a relationship  I don't talk to my family and I think I said that already  got in trouble with the law yeah it is  you still go to therapy  yes I go to a couple of them  you feel therapy in Hughesville  sometimes sometimes not depending what the the topic is  or we're probably talking about the same thing over again  the changes that I've noticed maybe a little bit less stress knowing that I have a couple more skills or tools to cope with my depression PTSD  not knowing when I'm going to have an outburst  controlling myself here in there  but it's it's a long process also on my recovery is going to be a forever process  when I made up with my girlfriend that was what two days ago  we are you and I talked about it with her and she was able to hear me out and I was able to hear her out and we fix things so that was the happiest moment so far  that's great  my case managers  done to my my group sessions  and my girlfriend even though it's much of a bitch she is she still good person  he asks why I have one best friend right now  and it's funny that you have because now that I remember he referred me as a saint which I don't think I do that I don't think I am that but I'm sure everybody's trying to say is that I'm a good person and I'm trying to do right and I don't want to inflict harm on nobody and I just want to get myself put back together and continue on you know start a new life yeah he did tell me something like that and I do consider you my best friend pretty cool they said that  what's something you did  recently what I really enjoyed  fishing I went with my friend Mikey fishing you caught a couple fish very quiet very fun  kind of you got to be patient  but it is relaxing it does take the edge off no one there to talk to no one there too  beer round on the open  now that's it  that's yet to come  I'm waiting for  thanks for sharing your thoughts  you're welcome  virtual  yeah  Lowe's interesting
717,male,0,1,0,20.0,717,okay if you notice that she pauses for more than about 20 30 seconds ahead and press that button it may be an indication that something's gone wrong  once again after she says goodbye go ahead and press this button and I'll come back in for you okay  hi I'm Ellie thanks for coming in today  and please  are you okay with this absolutely  doing good  enjoying the weather  Houston Texas  the weather at the beach marijuana  I can't think of nothing really  no I used to I used to be a truck driver but now I'm a student at La Trade Tech so I'm home base now  what do you enjoy about  Siri meeting different people  I'd like to hear  an experience when I went to North Carolina being there for the weekend the atmosphere was great so different beats type lifestyle imagine where to put it up  the party life is different  there's a lot of clubs over there so I mean I really had a night time during the weekend that I was there made a lot of nice people got laid  did you have a good memory  my most memorable experience  I really don't know which one to pick out for you I've been a lot of places and done a lot of things and a lot of time as far as me having asthma I have an attack it's a lot of things that I do forget but overall my past has been very good  diesel technology and learn how to do how to be a repair technician for like the buses diesel trucks anything is running out diesel they've taught me how to repair engines take them apart and put back together troubleshooting electrical work I'm really enjoying it because I like doing things with my hands and the thing is that they're teaching me I can use it for the rest of my life and I really is something that I can probably pass on the others so you know I really like it  what do you do now  all right now leave the time I ride my bike a lot going to do some parts of LA a lot of time to go to the beach I like Venice and Santa Monica Beach a lot  just Ashley just seeing this country and not the country but the city has a lot of places I haven't been I don't have a driver's license but just being able to ride my bike and go over the freedom to go where I want to I really love that  all right  what's your dream job  my dream job  motorcycle racing riding a motorcycle Superbike racing that's my dream job  me and my family with distant I'm in touch with my dad but as far as cousins and my mom we don't talk  sometimes when I'm feeling  what is the fastest guy  what do you do  smoke some weed and go to sleep  my zodiac sign is a Taurus so  it takes a lot to make me angry but if it's something that I know is someone that done something wrong I just simply try to tell them about it to correct them but being physical I tried not to get into that but you know you got people out there to really don't care about your feelings so sometimes I ain't walking away not dealing with him anymore  when was the  I'm going through a divorce I just experienced a domestic violence incident where me and her got nervous about who's going to clean the house so I took it upon myself to I punched in the shoulder and call the police on myself if I'm two days in jail I can order the home has been since January or right now I'm working on my divorce  I wish the best for her and the family meeting is no hard feelings about it you know  and at home if they have an apartment now on they're doing good but I feel that she should have been more friendly about the way we broke up because she changed the locks on the apartment and I didn't get a chance to get any of my like my tools and put paperwork birth certificate and whatnot she still has that but you know I feel like they to pick my life up and continue on you know I don't wish nothing bad about her hopefully she's happy I know that she's with the baby's daddy's come from Louisiana he's staying with her now and you know it is  how would I put it I'm not mad about it I'm more hurt the hurt feeling this what it is  I just did I wouldn't have got physical with her I felt it there was going this way so I called myself being away from the home a lot and she kind of noticed it but yeah he got me the convinced that you know me being a husband or you know a father figure that I'm supposed to be spending more time with the family so they can I change my perspective but when I done that my daddy call it putting all my ducks in the basket where she's got my social security number you know my information everything I just open myself up to her which have fell today you know it was a waste of time is a bad move but you know  Life Goes On  you feeling  I mean guilt come from doing stuff that you know you shouldn't have done  oh I don't do that in life I don't steal I mean live by the Bible so guilt I don't have that  Harley decision  I just made the decision that actually out of a reaction in a sense it's not hard for me to make a decision that's not like me  tell me about Nevada  dealing with women their best of the wrong women  I know it in the future that you know women are different that the ones who have done such is that individual is not an all-woman type thing but  right now in my life I just need the right one  I don't like being by myself I felt that me being married would alleviate that but I married the wrong one evidently hopefully that if I decide to take that step again that it be the right one this time because you don't you know you're getting old and time than went by and you can't bring that back  yes I'm a veteran  okay  how have you been feeling lately  how I feel  I never thought about it but me I feel good I mean I'm healthy I'm just glad you know you my freedom maybe in Black you really think about the fact of your other race being locked up a lot of history and I feel that me I'm doing good  so you know to me I'm happy about life  my association with women is different  I don't like whole conversation with women that don't know like I used to it's hard for me to like how you say start a relationship or friendship rather with a female now when it comes to men I'm not gay and I don't do gay things so we don't get that out of the way but as far as me and you know I don't have friends but when it comes to being advice you know I experienced that a lot of God few students classmates rather that kind of like leaning toward me when it comes to how would you say me helping them and I kind of like get in trouble for that so I guess you would say of me being outgoing I rather think about other people more than myself  my dad told me it's time for me to start thinking about me so I'm trying to get my mind into that frame where you know I'm just concentrating on better in life for myself now  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  find out what I had due to doing the day is no problem but I sometimes worry about the next day in about you know what's going to happen or how I'm going to handle it  I thought you know you sometimes get the dreaming about how thing is going to be in if it goes to the world  you know the dream leads to Didion or a bad situation you'll wake up from it it's not considered a nightmare but my body I wake up  and I don't sleep well I not doing today I mean I'm not irritable  emotionally unstable but I don't have problems sleeping if I sit too long in one spot and I know that I'm going to be there for more than 30 minutes I can go to sleep it's no problem for me  have you ever been diagnosed with  no  have you been diagnosed  no no depression  when was the last time  when men the ex-wife in a kids wear at the beach  we was all having a good time  positive influence  I really can't think of any way to slow down a floor that would be my daddy I mean you know he's made it to life and then made a lot of good things for people where you can sit back now and not really worried about things you know he just taking his last few days once you know one day at a time in a sense he really concerned about how I'm doing because the time of the seasons I made you know when it gets to the point where I ran into a problem I'll call him and give me advice about it and sometimes I don't do what he asked me to do or tell me to do it make you mad you know  you know especially like when it comes to female so I will say my dad  my best friend my best friend I'll be there  I guess  nice wait slow down  it's hard to think of that kind of stuff  I really don't pay attention to it  I'm most proud of  but I still have the desire to continue I'm proud of that I mean life's been good  okay  goodbye to YouTube

all these different packages and bundle them and derivatives that's no different from writing to me you know so it's the same thing so I just want to do something that's kind of creative and that's kind of aligned to just looking at new things in a different way and that's the way I've always been  I'm in general Eminem Morven I'm more of an outgoing kind of guy that's just but you know I don't mind you know when I'm home I'm kind I don't turn on the TV and and do whatever I'll pick up a book and I'll read a book as opposed to you know  you watching TV or playing Xbox or whatever so that's that's me  why because the other stuff doesn't seem it's interesting you know I think there's a lot of things that are really interesting and and and and and usually using your imagination and then picking up a book it's just kind of raw it's just you know Sun filter kind of thing so that's that's me  I have a great relationship with my family  I  have a wife and kids I also have a family is back in Alabama and Georgia and for my immediate family we we know I have to divide my time between that my only interest in my family but we do a lot of great things that are centered around the kids my wife is moral as an East coaster so she's from New York area so we do things that are  turn around her and him do things for the kids cuz the kids have interest so we I just tried to balance it and I have my stuff do some kind of last but we do have a lot of diverse interests which is great  what do I do to relax  I  I would my I'd like to go  I I like I think I'm pretty good at controlling my temper I'm more of a laid-back kind of guy I mean I'm that kind of guy you know I'm a little bit you know you just you know at some point you know it enough is enough but I I'm pretty I'm pretty polished and how I have done you know you know being an army been an army officer when I was in the military and going through all the cadet training and stuff you really do a lot and how they interact with management and so forth so I'm okay with track with my temper and everybody has their breaking point and what I do to relax I like to go for a walk mostly I like to be outside  I probably shan't argue with ya sure I could say I argue with my wife and it probably was about something related to the kids are the kids in money or something like that we have kid at for kids and integrate kids but but kids are a little expensive at times and then so I don't remember what it was but it was a ballet class or something like that and it wasn't necessarily free I'll put it that way and you know so we can if we had an argument about it because she was just one of those things where you know my wife you know you know you know if she if the kids has an interest and anything related to anything you say let's let's invest all of this in it and it's see what happens after while you like okay fine  a situation I wish I would have handled differently  I would probably  okay that's even the hardest decision I've ever had to make was when I was in the Army and I had to fire someone who has been in the service for 15 years that was pretty tough because this person went out and he had I guess made a bad decision you had a DUI and he had the family and he had people that depended on him and we had to remove them from this position and I was a junior officer at the time and I wasn't charged with with doing the firing so it's kind of weird size you know if someone you go out you have beer with there a drink with than and actually you know you got as far as first so that was hard because you know it's one of those things where are you  you really wanted things about the military at you you always hear the stories of where you shouldn't I guess been an officer you shouldn't be so involved with your peers are your subordinates and that's what the thing and it's it was true for me because I I was a cool laid-back kind of guy and and when it's time to make decisions like that their tot interpersonal because you you realize that you're affecting someone to livelihood and and that stuff  tell me about  yes that's her name of her  and in general I've been okay you know  not like  I've been okay some days are great some days are a crappy but on average there okay now it's not so what I call swing it away  not lately I do feel  that  I do feel that  the older I get the older I get I'm just more like you know inpatient about certain things you know just get you know you're you know you think that when you're younger or more  impatient  it's okay like I can easily is there something I said I better not as I guess I I find that  I can get a good night's sleep when  when I go to bed at a certain time if I go to bed too early it's it's not good  my falculty these are not old all their I need more to become engaged throughout my day and I'm easily distracted  I have not  I have not  I felt really happy I can say last weekend although I did have some down on me but I took my is my wedding anniversary and I took the wife and kids went to Disneyland and I guess it is a happiest place on Earth whatever but really young age where everything is you know you know everything is fun for them so that that makes me happy  my mom is been a positive influence in my life I did mention a group in Alabama group in a single-family household and she's always been encouraging and I think when they're so much discouragement around in many different package  they have someone that supportive it's always great you know it's always good to have that in your corner because you you going to get it you going to get rejection enough so but to have someone support you and your decisions is always good  I think my best friend would probably say that  I'm a hard worker have a strong work ethic that I'm generally someone who is responsible and easy-going kind of guy well-liked guy  something you did  what I'm most proud of I can say that that that makes me happy you know because it's something I think that you're under appreciated sometimes but the  I like when my kids now my oldest kid you know wants to show me something you worked on it's cool I mean I think that's great and he's eight and then it's just great and it's good because one day he's going to grow up and he's going to have a kid of his owner of a family of his own and so you know I I think the best thing I can do is give him that example of what it's like to be a dad and to be responsible that's something I never I never had I never saw so I'm kind of it's not like I have a textbook to go back in reference or anything but I think you know it makes me proud because you have little Minds that you're shaping you know a little people that that see what you're doing and and and that kind of want to be like you so that's kind of cool  you're welcome  goodbye  okay
