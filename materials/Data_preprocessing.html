/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

386 might have pulled something that  I&#39;m going to bring the great thanks so much  and please  are you okay with this yes  oh I&#39;m fine I&#39;m a little tired but I found out my thyroid is I think acting up so  where are you from originally I was born in Canada  but I&#39;ve lived in California most of my life so and it&#39;s gray today too so the gray weather makes you kind of see no sluggish  oh my gosh years and years ago  not at all I don&#39;t think I can text to her for a long time well the air fares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so travel as much as it&#39;s a fun thing to do it&#39;s cost-prohibitive so  oh that&#39;s see everything has plus and minuses cold-weather not as much sun so I think I&#39;d prefer getting more sun and having the warm-weather so but other than that it&#39;s it&#39;s very pretty back their natural scenery in but I like it here you know the traffic is kind of heavy but that&#39;s a small thing to deal with  why did I move to LA because my family came here and started to my dad got a job here and thus became our home base and  that&#39;s why  easy very easy sew  well in high school you generally study General Ed they have designated courses and then after that went to college and I was a business major let&#39;s say I was a Veterinary major and I graduated with a degree in Liberal Arts so  I don&#39;t know can&#39;t really pinpoint  I was working in Social Services but I&#39;ve also worked in sales and most recently I&#39;m doing real estate, leasing consultant part-time  I mean everything has plus and minuses it&#39;s it&#39;s okay it&#39;s not I don&#39;t really see too many negatives  oh probably to work as a gossip columnist it TMZ or one of those networks but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it&#39;s who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with cats you know animals  so  I&#39;m very outgoing in fact I think I&#39;m so echoing I scare people sometimes there&#39;s a lot of quiet you know Reserve people out there so I&#39;m kind of East Coast very you know I go up to people and talk to them first social  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver  oh my gosh there&#39;s I could do hundreds of things I could read I could watch a show turn on the music music is great take a walk call my friends  million things so  I&#39;m pretty good I&#39;m very good I mean you know of course when you&#39;re driving in LA and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes I can be irritating but I&#39;m I&#39;m actually pretty I&#39;m not the type of person that will fighter jet I don&#39;t like to have confrontations so  I can&#39;t really remember so that&#39;s why I said there&#39;s not very many arguments usually I avoid arguments at any cost so  do you feel guilty about  I don&#39;t really feel guilty about anything right now or that I can think of  I can&#39;t think of anything right now  I really can&#39;t think of any decisions that were really hard I mean most of it&#39;s pretty easy for make me to make a decision so I don&#39;t have a family so if I have to you know I had to moves to San Francisco for a job once but since I&#39;m single it&#39;s I don&#39;t really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so kind of makes certain things easier when you don&#39;t have other family to consider  yeah  in advance  well obviously you don&#39;t you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so I know when my father died you know I mean I wish I would have had him for a lot longer and he died at the age of 77 and you know what have been nice to have him around a little bit more  but you know I can&#39;t control those things life has its own way of dealing with that  yes there are Yin and Yang that&#39;s ancient philosophy and it really applies here is pluses and minuses the negatives and positives so  well like I said my dad&#39;s no longer here and my mother and I you know we have our differences I think mothers and daughters always do my brother and I get along great I see him a lot my sister works a lot I see her and you know we talked and she&#39;s kind of got her own life and her children I get along great with them so  we have a small family  once again it&#39;s like that&#39;s a hard question to answer there&#39;s so many types of kids up there I think majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved I mean you know there&#39;s always going to be children that are cut out of control but I don&#39;t know the ones that I&#39;ve seen recently the very well behaved so can&#39;t say much else about that  well I live in an apartment and I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever lived in apartment but there&#39;s someone that lives above me I&#39;m on the first floor and there&#39;s somebody on the second floor and they&#39;re pretty quiet but they have a habit of I guess they have lots of energy they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes I&#39;ll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall so it sounds like Niagara Falls and they are and so I don&#39;t ya and I need 8 hours of sleep and I&#39;ve only been getting oh I&#39;d say like maybe 6 hours and then I usually wake up once at night take a sometimes they&#39;ll kind of around 2 or 3 in the morning go either walk around or I&#39;ll hear something so I&#39;m not getting a straight 8 hours of sleep and it&#39;s definitely but there&#39;s not like I said there&#39;s things you can&#39;t control when you live in an apartment you know I means that the ladies look very quiet it  just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers question close at night that&#39;s I can&#39;t say anything to her about that  yeah but you know there&#39;s people that are in worse situations so I don&#39;t make a lot out of it you know and I just it&#39;s not like every night but it&#39;s you know at least twice a week so you know I have to consider sleeping in another room but for now you know that&#39;s I&#39;ll deal with it so  tired very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done cuz I don&#39;t have my energy also I haven&#39;t been exercising I normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather&#39;s been kind of colder and kind of dreary or so you know I&#39;m not as motivated when the weather is kind of blah so it&#39;s a combination of both not getting my exercise not getting 8 hours sleep  how you been feeling lately  as I said before tire has a combination of the weather you know I&#39;m here in Los Angeles right now we have been having very gray days I live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn&#39;t come out that much so I&#39;m not getting my serotonin I need that I am I getting my 8 hours of sleep because you know whatever and I think my thyroid is acting up too so that&#39;s kind of creating you know I have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the Sun comes out I&#39;m kind of more energetic it just gives you that more energy  have you ever been diagnosed with p  no  no  I hope I&#39;m happy most of the time I&#39;m a pretty happy person and I like to be around other people I mean of course I like my private time but I do like being around people quite a bit so  can&#39;t think of anything right now I mean I usually enjoy everything I do there&#39;s nothing that stands out more than anything else  okay  is there anything you regret know I never regret anything  what advice would I have given well I guess yeah I could probably change things around I think it everybody could I probably would have had a different college major in a seems like  what else I probably wouldn&#39;t have dated certain waste of time with certain people  I don&#39;t know those are them things that come to mind  maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things  but  how your best friend in Spanish  outgoing lots of fun to be with just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend I&#39;m loyal trusting and  I listen I&#39;m a good listener I&#39;m very patient as well so  what are some things you wish you could change about yourself  well I never wanted me to lose weight but I think that&#39;s a worldwide problem I mean there&#39;s a lot of food around and temptations and especially here in America a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we  you know it&#39;s just easy to real it&#39;s so easy to relax you know it&#39;s hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so that&#39;s the way that you know house gives you more energy to if you lose weight so that&#39;s a big thing as well but that&#39;s probably the thing just the weight thing you  I understand  how do your best friend describe you I think you might have asked me that question before her  but if you want I&#39;ll repeat it so  I&#39;m very like I said I&#39;m very loyal when I tell people I&#39;m going to do something I do it very reliable I am warm I&#39;m very friendly great listener and I mean I&#39;ve heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like I said I&#39;m very I&#39;m pretty upbeat you know I&#39;m don&#39;t let things get me down too much so  how have in your life  that&#39;s a hard question that can&#39;t think I mean I&#39;m  can&#39;t think of the answer that way so  4fun well I love movies so I could see every movie that they make I love going out with my friends shopping swap meets my gosh and traveling is great road trips  that&#39;s kind of  we know part of it yeah that I mentioned so  traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it the foods and joined Foods in different countries the architecture it&#39;s just kind of need to get away and see a completely different place  okay well I&#39;ve been to a lot of places in Europe I love Paris is such a walking City you can whoever designed that City I&#39;ll tell you I mean it&#39;s you can get from one point to another the Subways are great  each area has its own distinctive kind of there&#39;s the Latin quarter where the students are there is another area where let&#39;s say the fashion designers are kind of like our Rodeo Drive here in Beverly Hills there&#39;s an area that is more African and they have swap meets in the weekends that are wonderful is for international  and then like I said when she get out of Paris there&#39;s just so much history you can go see Versailles there&#39;s other palaces you can go to the south of France you know  but that&#39;s probably my favorite country I&#39;ve been to Italy as well so  yeah well after college people usually many people that go to college or either before or after college that&#39;s a great time to go to Europe because you&#39;re young and you&#39;re not tied down you don&#39;t have a family and you kind of have a more adventuresome Spirit you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases it&#39;s not not a big deal so yeah that&#39;s  thank you goodbye  oh that was that was fast  but I didn&#39;t never said there wasn&#39;t any like shocking question  never know I guess
361 yes I&#39;m doing great how about you  I&#39;m born in the US I was born in Orlando Florida  my parents my dad had a lot of friends in Los Angeles so decide to move here  he was pretty different I mean the place I was before was very it was a very small town we probably won&#39;t even notice it on the map so it was a big learning experience on cuz we know the schools were a lot larger in different cultures and ethnicities so it was a unique experience  last time I&#39;ve been back was probably about 5 years ago  definitely different my aunt she lives in again and she lives in a small town I&#39;m so if you want to go to a movie theater you have to drive out at least an hour or if you want to go to a mall it&#39;s it&#39;s an hour drive so I&#39;m the complete opposite of Los Angeles  convenience everything everything I could possibly want is here the weather is great shopping mall have a lot of friends here Sports place just kind of like the perfect area you know you don&#39;t want to live here kind of for the rest of my life actually  the big thing would probably be traffic I mean wherever you go there&#39;s going to be traffic with it on the 405 for the 101 it&#39;s it&#39;s just traffic you know I can kill like 2 hours in your day which is huge  quite a bit for a personal info for Business site travel you know he usually overseas or domestically my trouble so and I enjoyed a lot  I&#39;m singing different places different areas meeting new people eating different kinds of food being able to sightsee and tour if I have a day or two free I&#39;ll miss just experiencing now I&#39;m having new experiences just in riches my life  I&#39;m computers  and I also did English as well  yes I am  I&#39;m at work an it and it department at a Semiconductor Company  probably working for Apple since I pretty much when everything they have be great to work for Apple  I&#39;ll get it depends there are times when it&#39;s good to be alone but for the most part I consider myself an outgoing social person  nothing too much I guess if you kind of make a promising you and you break it several times and I might get a little bit make it a little bit annoyed but I don&#39;t think I would get really mad  all the questions I probably say I tend to eat a little bit more  just kind of keep my mind off of a little bit but usually doesn&#39;t last that long so it&#39;s a product I 10 that you. A little bit more more kind of like maybe junk food or something  I think I&#39;m pretty good I rarely get mad and if I do it doesn&#39;t really last that long so I think I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my temper again I really don&#39;t get angry so it&#39;s not really an issue for me  I said during the elections were talking about President Obama and Mitt Romney and you know who&#39;d be the best fit for the next presidency  that kind of got a little bit I guess a little bit heated but it was more for I guess more fun six and anything else but it was an interesting conversation  I like to eat out a lot watch movies play video games  disco out shop play sports watch the Laker game if I can if person would be probably the best bowling photography like doing a lot I like to do a lot of different things and of course like Tronics  the outgoing loyal intelligent funny and a great listener  no I have not  no  for most nights it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty easy just have to avoid drinking coffee or tea before I sleep more than that it&#39;s pretty easy  what&#39;s a little bit sluggish tired kind of reaction times a little bit slower aside from that nothing nothing too much like two glaring or anything the usual just being sluggish and not moving as quickly as I should  I&#39;m pretty good have no complaints  pretty much the same  I guess today I had my car maintenance today and it didn&#39;t cost me anything so that&#39;s great and I thought it was going to cost me you know something extra on the side but you know the the service advisor waved it so I got everything free today so I actually have a really good mood  nothing  probably don&#39;t spend as much save more money aside from that nothing else just be kind of more wise with your money  I&#39;m replacing my best friend  he&#39;s kind of a you know help me out and I help them out as well so it&#39;s been kind of a great learning experience. Developing our our friendship and he&#39;s bailed me out a couple of times I feel them out as well so it&#39;s kind of mutual thing we do you know what each other and it&#39;s a great way to bond as well  I say probably going back back to Korea to visit my relatives you know they are a lot more different than I remember 15 years ago when I was a kid I was actually kind of afraid of some of them but now that I see them you know recently they&#39;ve actually mellowed a lot and they&#39;re actually pretty fun to talk to you so it was kind of a learning experience for me because they&#39;re you know do they complete 180 from when I was at when I was a kid  I&#39;m sorry poem  guesswork would be part of it  buying my the car that I wanted to a couple years to save up to buy the car but I I paid it all off so I don&#39;t have any more car payment so that&#39;s great too and you know being able to help my family all this wall  let&#39;s see a couple weeks ago I went to Las Vegas for the 4 CS which is great if you fancy gadgets electronic song you get to see all the other goodies coming out this year so that was pretty interesting to see and some things that you know when you read on blogs they didn&#39;t talk about so you get to see it actually in-person kind of experience it from a user standpoint so I thought it was great and it&#39;s just fun is Conecuh being a kid in the candy store you get to play with different gadgets so it&#39;s really fun for me
492 get out my ass shadow  okay  hi I&#39;m Ali thanks for coming in today  yes  I&#39;m pretty good at drinking  Maryland  yes  85  yeah yeah it is long time  I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not as often as I like  out of work so you know the money issue  yeah  Maryland is different it in so the comparison is  the only comparison is that they&#39;re both cities but Maryland has its flavor in La has its own flavor so they have unique you know characteristics about themselves  I moved to LA because I was living in Hawaii and I was out of money and I just got enough for plane ticket I&#39;m coming stay here in a hotel until I found a job which I did really quickly anyway so that&#39;s why I came here I didn&#39;t want to go home I decided to come here and just start over  I am I am  it was really easy just did it  I like I like Ellie&#39;s whether I like the different areas in Los Angeles County West LA East LA I like Southern California you know. So you know like the people but yes I like them the  attitude you know the LA attitude so yeah  I don&#39;t like I don&#39;t like some of the policies with regard to the smoking you know I really wish that the government would crack down on smoking on the streets make it like USC yeah  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a  no not outside of but getting on the bus and things like that  I was studying to be a nurse  yeah  I wanted to have a job that pays well but afforded me the opportunity to use my service gift so yeah  no I had to put that put that on the side and I want to get a business degree now  yeah my dream job is  is 2  create new technology  can you tell me about that  other than to say I would like to create something that will change the world like Steve Jobs with his iPhone  yeah  I am it depends on the situation but I&#39;m more outgoing  I do tend toward the little shyness from time to time  what I do is I&#39;ll go to the movies  I went to the movies probably like maybe 5 weeks ago  yeah  well I had an argument recently not really argument but a disagreement with a woman at my church who is over this particular Department that I&#39;m in and it&#39;s a volunteer position I use my Administrative Assistant more executive assistant skills to to I do minutes for meetings that I cover and until then I have to produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that and this person is micromanaging me but not micromanaging the other admin assistant who did not get her block of people into this particular meeting so the meeting should have been comprised of a hundred people but we have like maybe 30 even 3020  yes so now she doesn&#39;t know that I realize you know that part of it so there was a little bit of a argument and but again not a argument but a disagreement and when we talk again I will point out to the person that&#39;s over both of us that there is a disconnect and the energies she&#39;s investing in me is unprofitable for what we&#39;re trying to achieve  that does not sound good  well a little attacked  you know so  it depends on I&#39;m very good at controlling my temper it&#39;s you know there are places where you can allow your temper to come out even though it might not be appropriate and then there are other places where if it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot so I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my temper  yeah  I don&#39;t have any situation recent that I can think of  probably say just dealing with a neighbor instead of responding to the neighbor just ignore the neighbor all together so I wish I&#39;d done that differently  yeah  thankfully  I&#39;ve not had to make that type of decision in my life as yet  I have what I do in my life and then and you know in my  going forward you know everything that I&#39;ve done and everything that has happened I  accept it as something that has to be to get me to go for it I am a born again Christian and so I know that that God is Sovereign over my life and also that according to his word the Bible says that everyday of our life is written in his book so events and circumstances I feel that I feel they are ordained by God not obviously I&#39;m not going to jump into a burning fire or do anything ridiculous but  I feel that things that have that have happened even if I&#39;ve dealt with them the wrong way it&#39;s God&#39;s his total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good so that&#39;s how I feel  I have all brothers and so I&#39;m not really that close with my brothers  and my mother  say that again  people that have grown up with neighbors from when I when I was younger that I was close to different friends that I&#39;ve had along the way friends who are more like family so yeah  they&#39;ve had positive influence  that&#39;s I get I sleep too well  so I sleep well every night  normal but I my normal I&#39;ve been feeling my normal  no  no  no  that was really something happened  I was able to participate  with my church on Sunday with I was a Pentecost it was Pentecost Sunday meeting it was 50 days after the resurrection of Jesus Christ and so I was able to participate in a prayer session that we had at my church and I thought that was really made me very happy  that I&#39;m smart they would say that I&#39;m smart that  that I handle difficulties very well  and then I dress well  I don&#39;t want to change anything I do want to just be a better me so be a better person so I am working on listening better communicating better and and accepting my  weaknesses better as well as my strengths  no  that&#39;s a good question I would have I would have told myself to  to do what I know to do to do what I know that which is right and  I can do what I know is right and let everything else let the other chips fall where they may but to do what I know to do is right and they go forward  I am very proud of the fact that I don&#39;t give up  bye and thank you see you all  thank you  I&#39;m deaf
414 hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in space  and please  are you okay with this  yeah  how are you doing today  I&#39;m okay  Burbank California  yeah  the weather of course I think everyone likes the weather  it&#39;s not too  City like Chicago or New York it&#39;s a big enough we have beaches we&#39;re not landlocked  sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that I&#39;ve just been here like my entire life almost  okay  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer  do you travel a lot  not enough as I&#39;d like to I go to school in Chicago and I&#39;ve been to New York a couple times San Francisco and I took a road trip across the country that was cool I saw a couple States  what do you enjoy about traveling  see new places  going to Landmark that I&#39;ve only  read about ER theme pictures of  I traveled from Los Angeles to Chicago taking Route 66 and the best part was seeing the Grand Canyon for the first time it was  the coolest thing I&#39;ve ever seen probably  happy  and then Happy was as beautiful it was nice  I haven&#39;t felt like that in a long time  I&#39;m studying film  it&#39;s just  something I&#39;ve always loved for as long as I could remember and when it came time to start applying to schools I wasn&#39;t sure what I wanted to do and I apply to Northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision  dream job  I love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so  comedian I&#39;m coming a comedic actor would be totally great but  you consider yourself more shy or  I am super outgoing and I love talking to people a lot I like I like being the center of attention usually  hey  but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  I  I like to watch mindless television like Toddlers &amp; Tiaras and Duck Dynasty just TV programs were really don&#39;t have to pay attention at all  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  I&#39;m okay at it I get really emotional really fast but I am usually able to use to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part  sometimes I get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily  and I hate apologizing to people so besides could last pretty long  my best friend Ryan I think  and it was about  our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and cross some lines and  where how we were going to go back to the way it was before  how hard is that  really hard it&#39;s he&#39;s my best friend and I miss him  but we messed up and this is just not the same  it&#39;s like not the same friendship  me too  too many  I guess  when I have a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend because not okay I wish I would have just  realize that this was bad and just would have stopped there and not have let it continue 4 weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up  I guess not spend as much time with him as I did  be more assertive  I guess  it was  in November  I was very depressed and suicidal  so I told my friend what I was feeling and that she needed to take me to the ER  and from the ER I have the choice to  I don&#39;t know I guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital  and even though I felt like I didn&#39;t have a choice I knew it was my choice and I decided to go to the mental hospital which is like the worst experience of my life ever  it was awful it was in Chicago and  it was scary and I didn&#39;t know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just  start giving you medication and you&#39;re basically left to your own devices they were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and they were all really old and it was scary I didn&#39;t know anyone everyone most of the people there weren&#39;t depressed they were violent so that was pretty scary and I just dumb it was really hard for me  I had been so depressed for like a month I stopped going to my classes and work and I told my teachers lies about being sick and I just kept calling in sick to work I dropped a class and I was failing my classes and not turned in any work and I wasn&#39;t talking to any of my friends and I was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and  I was just in a really bad place and when I finally was going to kill myself I realized I needed help  it was  I had severe depression when I was a younger teenager and I tried to kill myself then and I got put in therapy for quite some time so I figured I don&#39;t want to go down that bad path again I just want to get better  so I had to do it I had to get help  I do I go once a week  I feel like if you have the right therapist it&#39;s really useful  I had one therapist that I really liked and I thought we could have gone really far but sadly she&#39;s back in Chicago and I&#39;m in Los Angeles so I have to  have to make do with this new therapist and she&#39;s okay  just not we&#39;re not that great together but she&#39;s who I have right now  better than nothing  not that easy at all  ever since I got out of the hospital and start a night began medication for my depression  just haven&#39;t been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying asleep is hired have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up in are disturbing  like what  I guess just  sometimes they reflect things that I&#39;m worried about are happening in my life but they&#39;re just  the scary and they seem so real that sometimes I wake up and I have to ask my mom like did we go here to be do this to this really happen and it&#39;s usually know you dreamed that sometimes I&#39;ve gotten so scared I like talk in my sleep and wake myself up  probably like two nights ago  wow  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  that is a  hard question  I think  and November  after I got out of the hospital  I finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown Chicago and we went to the Sears Tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was with the cool  how your best friend  probably  super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy  I try not to regret things in my life  I would say that living is worth it and just don&#39;t be afraid to ask for help when you need it don&#39;t wait until it gets really bad  I guess my ideal weekend would be sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends may be going home with them and bake some cookies eat all the cookies watch some TV have a sleepover and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies I would like to do my free time  go for a walk I don&#39;t know go to the beach  that is a hard question I mean I think I&#39;ve done a lot of great things in my life  and I have achieved a lot but  I think one of the proudest things badass moments in my life is something really small and insignificant I was doing this exercise boot camp and  the last persons like cross the finish line had to do like  30 pushups and it was some guy I didn&#39;t really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone want to help him if he&#39;s going to help them you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and then I just decided to start doing push ups with him and I just  it wasn&#39;t cuz I wanted to get creditor because I thought it would make me look good I just did it and no one really knows about that but it&#39;s just I feel really good about that  is my Buy  press the button

I can be very frustrating and real when people to really I&#39;m trying to find the right words to good stuff that really bothers me too  spray painting on the wall  Jess  going garbage anywhere not picking it up not really being you know not really being  hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what I mean  when I do when I&#39;m annoyed I get really upset I really start really cussing people out to be honest with you and it&#39;s something that&#39;s not really me but I&#39;m learning to really let go of it a lot to know just so you know just say hey that&#39;s the way it is it&#39;s like I&#39;m not in control I can&#39;t control it  yeah I only have to control the things about what I do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good it&#39;s not good for me  all my Timbers camping control I can show the pretty well  I think it probably would but my sister and she&#39;s very controlling and it&#39;s like you have your life and I have mine don&#39;t tell me what to do  yeah  we were so close I can get along with him for real clothes I have no problems with them  yeah very good  this morning  yeah wake up pretty you know out at first thing I do when I wake up in the morning I pray so we&#39;ll Nice Spirits in connection with the the universe in the world I feel pretty good  yes  up and down Uno up because I&#39;m motivated to get out and start doing other things in life and just not doing anything at all and then the times where you want to get something accomplished and you can&#39;t really get it done because there&#39;s Roblox in the way but I&#39;m learning how to overcome those roadblocks as well  well for instance looking to go to school and I was having problems getting enrolled in school I was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and the do it so I&#39;m like okay it was going to get done  yeah  can you repeat that one more time out  yes I have  that had to be the last couple of weeks I noticed that I go through certain situations like he was talking about the anger situation is like I don&#39;t get angry all the time that&#39;s not me so sometimes when I get angry I have to find out what&#39;s causing all this what&#39;s what&#39;s causing me to get angry  and I have to take Schism now  it&#39;s not hard at all cuz you have to do is just take your time in the reflect about everything that you have gone through and take a good look at the situation and and then go from there and find out what&#39;s really bothering you  it&#39;s very seldom I suffer from PTSD and getting that type of sleep would be would be great  because I have recurring nightmare so of an incident so  I I think it is and I don&#39;t know what is triggered by but I think it is and that&#39;s why I&#39;m talking to someone or seeing someone cuz I&#39;m a veteran at the VA about the situation now  about to PTSD basically right now  change mail  a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues depression I noticed all this in me and  I started. Just started to just tell myself I need it out  and as that&#39;s basically I just so you know I just you know I did something wrong with the one right with me and when something&#39;s not right with me I have to take time out to just take a good look at myself and ask myself if something&#39;s right then you did something right then that&#39;s fine something not right then you need to take care of it and just start shaking help down there yeah  someone yes it is someone  because I&#39;m able to sit down and talk to the therapist  well I&#39;m able to sit down and talk to the therapist and tell him I situation and we usually will go over to the problem and I went to classes I&#39;ve been to talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it&#39;s helping a little bit  yeah that&#39;s a good thing  sketch map  no no not really  my best friend  they he will describe me as a fun-loving good person always there. Try to help others think more about is really them more myself but when I know I needed things need to be done for me I take care of it so you know they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me  yeah they see something in me they wished that they at  gmail  can you be a little bit more specific  okay  books crossword puzzles walking that&#39;s about it  I thought I did but I don&#39;t think I do I don&#39;t think I regret anything because  this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so I accept it and I keep moving on  because if I regret anything in the past then I&#39;m wasting my time on that because it&#39;s gone that&#39;s the past I need to move on I need to live in the present so I can be prepared for the future like move on to the Future  yeah  more education  being more direct and more confidence in what I&#39;m doing like I am today so yeah that&#39;s what I was lacking maybe 20 years ago  yes I have had a lot of pots of the people been been in my life  yes I&#39;m people with can consistently motivate me to continuing to pursue a certain goal and I thought that was pretty good because I really don&#39;t see that a lot and  they gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do so I can think of anything that you do it&#39;s a choice it&#39;s up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done  excuse me ma&#39;am  that I&#39;m able to really be able to be self-motivated and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished. Thought I couldn&#39;t but it can be accomplished if I&#39;m willing enough to put the will to it to do it  Paul wow huh  oh really and you know what I really enjoyed was sitting down with my social worker and we&#39;re talkin about getting things done within my life and school was one of them and just being just school was one of my kind of liked it that because I was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me  yeah and I thought that was a great dane so as long as you&#39;re willing to do that and I&#39;m willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school  and then then that&#39;s what gets me going  so it is and I love it and this is going to be accomplished  thank you  goodbye  yeah I think she&#39;s through  jackass she was really human wow before technology

sold it and I could have handled it in a much different way  fear  can you tell me about that  I was afraid of mounting debts I was afraid of  the economy wasn&#39;t good this 2007/2008 I was not thinking clearly I was afraid of mounting debts I was afraid of being sued by employees I was afraid of  yeah not having enough money I was afraid to be embarrassed I was  embarrassed you know for running out of money  yeah I would have handled that much different knowing what I know today  it was  yes I could have I could have downsized I could have  downsized sold cars got rid of cars I  could have cut hours I could have reduced my expenses and sat tight with it and not and just worked through it to not have reacted out of fear  when  I got my bachelor&#39;s degree in political science from UCLA and I just finished a master&#39;s degree in education  my dream job  my dream job  is  to not work that&#39;s my dream job  do not work to be of service to people to  you know of two  wear casual clothes not have to be at a particular place at a particular time  to have time to enjoy you know the one of the things that I like to do like fishing and Hiking being with my nephew&#39;s being with kids  yeah and not having to work  well relationship with family okay so who&#39;s alive today is my mom my father died when I was 16 my stepfather died three years ago I lost my mom&#39;s alive we have a good relationship she&#39;s like and it took a lot of work it took years you know but she&#39;s my we&#39;re friends you know we do stuff together my sister she lives a half a block away from me my sister lives a block away from me she&#39;s got five kids and a husband and a family to contend with and my sister and I don&#39;t get to spend a lot of time together anymore she&#39;s got her life you know she&#39;s busy life the rest of my family is lives in Belgium who I went to go see and some and that&#39;s all the family that I have I have an aunt that is very I&#39;m a strange 2 and she lives in Northern California and we never talk  because she  she ripped off the Family Estate my grandson my grandparents estate she she took all the money and all the stuff and and left her grandkids and her and Mike you know and so her sister and my my grandmother&#39;s daughter and grandkids and great-grandkids got zero  and it was a few few few million dollars so we don&#39;t talk  I don&#39;t talk we don&#39;t talk  and it&#39;s sad  excuse me can you repeat that  wowed house if my father was a positive influence he was a really genuine man honest funny handsome I have a business owner a businessman that I work for who was it extremely positive influence at least in my professional life I&#39;ve had a counselor at UCLA who was totally I think of her  often and some of the little things that she said to me keep me going in my life now  trust the process  she told me to trust the process and when people are having trouble and I&#39;m having trouble I take it step back and say you know just trust the process it it it all works out the way it&#39;s supposed to be  I&#39;m just one more positive influence that I knew in Hawaii that taught me  a friend of mine that lives on Kawaii that taught me  how to enjoy nature and taught me how to fish and and I love her a lot too great positive influence healthy healthy influence  it&#39;s not  I have back problems so it&#39;s hard to sleep at night and I wake up in the middle of the night sort of  stretching and straightening out my back I have a back issue that sometimes more often than not  keeps me from sleeping good  that&#39;s okay I&#39;m dealing with it  I&#39;m a little depressed I&#39;ve been a little depressed I haven&#39;t been working as much and  I you know I have pain in the mornings and in the evening I have pain throughout the day and night with my back and it&#39;s just a little depressing you know I get depressed all so you know just thinking about my business that I sold and you know where I would have been if I hadn&#39;t of done that and  a general feeling of  I&#39;ve been a little depressed over the past couple of years actually  yes  well I&#39;ve been diagnosed many many years ago and I guess depression stays with you although it gets treated and I was diagnosed about two years ago I think I don&#39;t know what to ask me that on the questionnaire as well and I sought treatment for it and then my insurance ran out and the prescriptions I couldn&#39;t put the do my prescriptions anymore but now I&#39;m back on medication and so I take medication for my depression  therapy absolutely  I love therapy  wow that&#39;s huge confidence and self  confidence in myself confidence in my decision-making a general feeling of  overall content a sounding board you know when I have stuff that&#39;s bothering me that I can&#39;t go to the I feel that I can&#39;t go to the person with I can go to my therapist in  a lot of times the issue is resolved there it wasn&#39;t a big issue or I work through it or the therapist through the therapist allowed me to look at a different way of looking at the situation and in that way I find therapy to be invaluable actually  I believe so yes I was  I believe it was and he was told to me by a psychiatrist that that&#39;s what I was that&#39;s what I was having and this was within the last five years I think it was  looking back now  what are we 2013 it was 2009 so 4 years ago  I&#39;m not able to deal with like Shell Shocked not able to deal with anything irritable on the phone I mean just just anything would get me to fly off the handle and I&#39;m just not able just shell-shocked and not hiding it my in my house not opening mail not being able to concentrate not being able to deal with  with things that were that I felt were will that were bombarding me I felt overcome and the psychiatrist said that it was supposed to matter stress disorder butts and I was given some medication which I stayed on for a year or so or so and I don&#39;t know through Psychiatry and therapist and medication I was able to come out of my shell a little bit  about a week ago I was on a hike and up in Malibu and at this beautiful Labrinth that looked over the Pacific Ocean and I was with a friend and we were having lunch  and I lay down in the grass and took a nap and I felt content I was happy at that moment at that moment that time a week ago  honest sincere  smart  caring  smart  good question  I&#39;d have to think about that  yeah I have regrets in life and everything works out so you know if I could change the past I would have never dropped out of school when I did a long time ago I mean I&#39;ve since gone back and completed lots of stuff I probably would have gone into the military I think I was going to do that in my early twenties I&#39;m 55 now I sort of regret not doing that at that time  I regret  selling my business  I regret  of course I can&#39;t control this but I regret that my father died when I was so young and  he never really got to know me and I never really got to know him  I regret  I regret not seeing  my grandmother enough before she passed away  I regret  I mean those are the things that I can think of right now not putting away for retirement I regret when I had the money to do it  yeah I mean just here that&#39;s what I would say  stick with it  just stick with it because in order to get out you have to go through and  I when it comes to fear or flight I get the fear and I flight so sometimes you just have to sit in fear and then  everything works out  wow  I&#39;m most proud that I have remained  genuine I&#39;m most proud of  being who I am and being basically comfortable with that and I&#39;m proud of that I haven&#39;t changed  to the warp to the world you know for the world I haven&#39;t changed I&#39;ve stayed  who I am  thank you  thank you  bye
325 start a chat with you for a bit and then  okay  yes  I&#39;m fine this is a little bit strange you know talking to a virtual human  I was born I was born that way I was raised out in the suburbs I&#39;ve lived all over Los Angeles live in the valley Long Beach and now I&#39;m in Culver City  there&#39;s great food here the weather is great most of the time is a lot of sunshine it doesn&#39;t get cold I don&#39;t have to shovel snow there are lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people I think that&#39;s really great  that is a much longer left I would like to get out of here the the traffic heading that&#39;s number one I think everybody hits in traffic and everybody&#39;s so busy all the time it&#39;s really hard to to get together with anybody everybody so devoted to their jobs and then we&#39;re sitting in traffic a lot too  I just graduated actually I study marine biology  I was I went to school and I recently studied graphic design and I found that kind of unfair feeling so I took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and I realize that I really love marine biology so that&#39;s how I got into it  everybody&#39;s been asking me that a lot lately since I just graduated I think I would like to I think maybe managing a managing a research  you know I&#39;m not I&#39;m not really sure I think I would like to  Something in tropical Marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve something like that hard question to answer  I do  I like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world  I travel for 8 months in Central America and I visited a lot of different countries I  I went scuba diving  I think I think intolerance Injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up  Brett&#39;s my boyfriend does that count  I&#39;m pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me fired up to the point where I am going to blow my top of the very few people have seen me angry to the point where I&#39;m kind of yelling and screaming and I don&#39;t know I just don&#39;t get there I think that I&#39;m a little bit afraid of losing my temper so I keep it under control  if it was yesterday Ashley I argued with my boyfriend about getting getting a job I was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and I really wanted him to to say no don&#39;t go take that job for 6 months cuz I miss you and he was just being supportive so we kind of argued about that it was ridiculous so we I ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight  meditate exercise go out in nature just unplug at myself away from computer away from Technology Way from people  I would say not really I&#39;m an only child and it&#39;s just me and my parents and we&#39;re very very dissimilar for example I&#39;m a pretty adventurous person and I like learning and my parents are couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don&#39;t have too much to talk about or things that we can really do as far as shared activity so you know I love them and everything but there&#39;s not too much common ground  guess I think about our social introvert but I seem to find most social encounters to be draining where is my my boyfriend for example he drives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people from me it&#39;s always a little bit the opposite I have to recharge  not sure I have a best friend but I guess I&#39;ll see my boyfriend he&#39;s he&#39;s kind of my default best friend he would probably say passionate intelligence he always tells me that I&#39;m really hard on myself which is true dedicated loyal  I think I&#39;m just proud of who I am going to I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the answer that most people have but I think that I&#39;m I&#39;m really proud of who I am I try really hard I&#39;ve done a lot of things in my life I&#39;m a really good person I think it&#39;s kind of rare to find people that are kind and I consider myself a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so I&#39;m I&#39;m proud of that  no I have not  no  yes  I was probably about 15 at the time so I think he was that 17 years ago  yes  I was cutting and my one of my best friends called called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment that wasn&#39;t the first time I had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but before it was more they thought I&#39;d ADHD so it was I think my parents really took me and rather than me seeking help  I haven&#39;t for about 3 years I stopped because it felt like I was check in with a parole officer I just wasn&#39;t enjoying the relationship I had but I still have a psychiatrist that I go to for Med checks  I do think it&#39;s useful if you have the right therapist I think if you don&#39;t have a good relationship with your therapist you can be incredibly harmful I have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won&#39;t ever go back  lately I&#39;ve been a little bit down since a little bit more down than usual because I graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things 24/7 has come to an end and without the routines been a little bit weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it&#39;s also been a little bit depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn&#39;t translate to real-world skills and there aren&#39;t that many jobs for marine biologist in California  almost impossible ever since I was a little kid I had to Chaya trouble falling asleep and about four years ago it became really really bad where I just couldn&#39;t sleep through the night I was getting about 4 hours of sleep sometimes I would wake up every hour and I wake up in the morning just to complete wreck so for about 4 years I&#39;ve been taking trazodone so I can sleep  have you ever seen Fight Club your virtual human so you probably haven&#39;t seen that but it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty much like that I  I&#39;m just a complete Panic anxious reggae I lose my ability to deal with  at least my ability to deal with things I&#39;m much more likely to lose my temper I can&#39;t regulate my moods I&#39;m just really volatile  probably a few months ago I think that I may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgot to take my medicine with me or something like that and then I can&#39;t sleep in so that&#39;s what happens  really happy I mean it&#39;s easy for me to be easier for me to keep track of when I feel really really bad really happy I guess I felt happy on New Year&#39;s really happy on New Year&#39;s Eve which was  10 days ago I was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to Palm Springs and Joshua tree and it was really nice to see them I don&#39;t get to see them very often because I&#39;ve been in school and I&#39;ve been so busy as it was really nice reintroduction to real life  I think that I am I&#39;m kind and considerate I&#39;m tolerant I&#39;m pretty open-minded I&#39;m aware of my faults I just tried to be nice to everybody and  I&#39;m very curious about about the world and things that I don&#39;t know about I really like to learn  off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue hole in Belize that was really amazing it was me and my friends we just jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this Limestone sinkhole and its really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in  something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and as you go down then you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they&#39;re huge there larger than a human at cuz it&#39;s this cave system and its really murky and there sharks swimming around 2 or so  that&#39;s pretty good  I&#39;m trying to remember that the moment I haven&#39;t had much free time the last three and a half years being in school is reading hiking just being together with my friends doing relatively low key things going to movies having dinner parties cooking thing with my cat  not that I can really think of I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve made mistakes in my life but you know I&#39;m still here so can&#39;t be that bad  I know hang in there I hold onto your clothes cuz the 90s are coming back in fashion  cloudy weather beautiful sunsets being in being out in nature kind of being away from the hubbub of the city  getting a good grade  I think my boyfriend has he&#39;s just especially the last year he&#39;s really inspired me he quit drinking he quit smoking he&#39;s made a lot of positive changes in his life and I know that those things aren&#39;t aren&#39;t hard or aren&#39;t easy I should say so to see someone overcome that really inspired me  okay

650 number to certify recording equipment  and please  okay  absolutely yes  okay  so how are you doing today  you doing okay  where you from  born and raised in New York City  the city life and the fast pace  what are some things you don&#39;t  cost of living is pretty expensive  you travel a lot  not recently I traveled mostly while I was in the military  why  the military is always on the go so most of the travel being so expensive  I could only afford it through traveling on Military business  for the military or outside of the military  what you said  akademiks foreign languages  private security  okay  what&#39;s your dream job  probably in the same industry private security that would be high paying  or something along the lines of mental health for  something like what we&#39;re doing right now  was it helps provide for the family pay the bills  you consider yourself more shy  more outgoing than shy  well I&#39;m  I watch TV and spend time with my family  very good actually very very controlled I have two in my field  it was with my wife and it was about finances  wish you would  that&#39;s a good question  I believe I  coming to California and leaving my oldest daughter&#39;s in Florida  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had  leaving the military it was for finances and  and I knew I had to go so I 1997 I made the choice and all I had known was the military so that was pretty hard  tell me about Nevada  probably some of my past before the military  I was in a relationship  not a not a girlfriend boyfriend relationship I was  basically victimized by my mother I wish I could erase that but in a way it kind of makes me who I am  yes almost 9 years US Air Force  18 years old  had no other choice it was either go in the military or stay out on the streets in New York City I had no money for college and no chance of getting a good job so I enlisted  are you happy you did that yes absolutely probably the best choice Inn in fixing  my life growing up that I ever made  three separate times yes  I had some Growing Pains at first it was a little bit difficult in the beginning but I adjusted  private security  and then law enforcement  it gave me a sense of  sense of regimentation it gave me  structure that I wouldn&#39;t have otherwise gotten and I believe as far as within people  and in just the the general population that does set you aside with set you apart  alright I guess in a bit of a struggle sometimes  just seeking employment and it&#39;s very difficult especially with the way things are  have you noticed any changes in your  not really just trying to trying to land that dream job as you said before  pretty easy especially if I&#39;ve been active throughout the day and that&#39;s usually every day  what are you like  tired first of all  and can&#39;t concentrate well  yes I have  long time ago  my goodness 19  90  1992  1992  cold sweats  nightmares night terrors  disorientation waking up  not knowing where I am  things of that sort  are you triggered by something  not that I&#39;m aware of it was  it was almost mostly  following one of my combat experiences in South America  I went to Columbia  one on President Bush&#39;s War on Drugs and  we had the  wait we had to live in the jungle and while in the jungle we also had to take a couple of lives while we were there we so that was one of the three instances that I saw Combat Action  I learned a long time ago that you have to put your past behind you so  I I just do I had to put it behind me it was  not easy  but it was the right thing  to do and it was so That Others May Live so it was it may not have felt right at the time but it was the right thing to do  what country is this  in the military when you have a combat-related experience you always go through a debrief  at the debrief you are asked if you need help coping with the situation  so of course I immediately raised my hand told him I need help with coping with the situation it took roughly about  want to say somewhere around three weeks to a month of seeing a therapist  and  once they they gave me some key exercises to do the the acuteness of the night terrors in the nightmares went away  it was at first  and very seldom am I bothered by it now because it was so long ago  no absolutely not  why did you stop  I didn&#39;t need it anymore I learned enough coping skills that we&#39;re good enough to be able to cast that aside and not depend upon any facet of treatment or anything else  you feel therapy in Haysville  yes I do feel it is  throwing medication at that kind of problem  sometimes it&#39;s necessary but in my case I don&#39;t feel it is and I will not be dependent upon medications but the therapy 100% I agree especially speaking to somebody when I&#39;m one it does help  can you tell me about that  tell you about the therapy and how effective it is  I don&#39;t go to therapy anymore  I only went for a months after my Combat Action in Columbia  when was the  really happy about 3 weeks ago  can you tell me about that  it was on payday  didn&#39;t have very many positive role models of very few especially in my childhood I had a lot of negative examples on what not to be  so positive role models are probably say most of my superiors in the military that was my biggest growth experience in my life  how&#39;d your best friend  as his big brother the guy who taught him everything my best friend feels that  I helped him out in building himself up work-wise  watch my daughter  do some martial arts at her school I really enjoy that

well now it takes a lot to get me to give me angry I&#39;m more passive now than I ever have been and I I like that about myself  when was the last time  I argued with my best friend probably wasn&#39;t like a real serious argument but we argued a little bit about a religion which I don&#39;t like to go into a r i don&#39;t like 2 to get into arguments about but unfortunately we got into argument about religion she wanted me to she wants me to join her religion I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s right what I should do and I so we got into a little dispute about that  better situation that  Etsy  there&#39;s many many many situations that I wish I had it handled differently and one of them was my children I wish I could have been  I wish I could have been a better dad to my kids I wish I could have made better decisions for my children and I didn&#39;t  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about my guilt I feel guilty about that about not being a good parent to my kids at many times in my life and that guilt stays with me my whole life everyday I think about it  tell me about  let&#39;s see the hardest dishes decision I&#39;ve ever had to make  I wish I could erase from my memory  the last time that  having  getting divorced would be one of the last things with the memory of that relationship going bad was probably one of the things of the last excuse me one of the things I&#39;d like to erase from my memory  the last time I interacted with my ex-wife  yeah I was in the Navy  how old are you  I was 18  just a kid  well to be honest with you I was 18 years old and I didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go I was homeless and it was either be homeless on the street at 18 or join the military and try to do something with my life and so that&#39;s what I chose to do  are you happy you did  yeah  in a way out you know I got out I got out of the military and wish I had stayed in longer so yeah It ultimately I&#39;m glad I did that  no never saw combat I was in an 80 86 and 87 those years and I was in the Cold War era I was stationed on the  and my ship was dry dock for a little while so I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t see combat they didn&#39;t have combat at that time  how easy was it for you to go  I think it was too easy for me I just did actually I just did real well getting out and and I&#39;m getting back into civilian life I went in with it with both feet running and so yeah it was it was wasn&#39;t hard at all  alright  what did you do  after the military  I work several different jobs looking didn&#39;t thinking about what career I wanted to choose I apply for the sheriff&#39;s department didn&#39;t make the sheriff&#39;s department but got into working for different private investigative companies at that time and that&#39;s how I ended up working and getting into Workman&#39;s Comp fraud and different surveillance and investigative aspects of a private investigation so I work 5 investigation a little time after getting out of the military  how did serving in the military change you  it taught me honor atami dignity you taught me respect it it taught me how to  to Listen and Obey chain of command it kind of grew me up a GroupMe

comfort me in and help me to get through the the scary feelings I feel and I try to get support from the little friends I have in the few family members I have and I just try to tell myself everything&#39;s going to be okay it&#39;s it&#39;s not what I&#39;m thinking you know things aren&#39;t the way I think they&#39;re they are in my head those those kind of coping mechanisms  I couldn&#39;t take it anymore I was having a  still pressing up in the hospital  this feeling like I said feeling tired of being scared all the time couldn&#39;t I just couldn&#39;t deal with it anymore so I ended up getting help and I&#39;m glad I did and it&#39;s a day-by-day struggle I still struggle everyday to to do Skip by but I basically I&#39;m doing okay I&#39;m hanging in there  it&#39;s very hard  yeah I go to therapy like probably once a month I take meds for it helps me out a lot  I probably should be going to therapy more but it&#39;s once a month right now  all right  you feel therapy in Hughesville  I think it&#39;s useful if you&#39;re serious about it and you take it seriously and you have the right therapist and everything is  the right Dynamics are there I think it&#39;s very useful yeah  well I think that  if you if you go if you&#39;re going just to go it&#39;s not going to help if you&#39;re going to seat the true answers to get help I think it&#39;s it&#39;s going to it&#39;s going to work it&#39;s good you&#39;re going to get help it&#39;s good things will work out but if you&#39;ve got the wrong person to talk to their that the chemistry is not there or the education or whatever Dynamics are involved aren&#39;t working they&#39;re not in sync with each other either on your side of the of the therapist is there is going to be  more difficult for the for the solution to be a positive when I think  I don&#39;t know I I I don&#39;t know if I said that properly but basically yeah  let&#39;s sort of changes have I noticed  I&#39;m more of a positive person actually that I that I ever have been was completely negative about everything for so many years I&#39;m more positive I have more hope even though I have days of hopelessness more hope I feel more secure Within Myself and I feel like I&#39;ve got a release I&#39;ve got somebody that I could talk to  that will then understands me and somebody that could really relate with  when is the  you know  I don&#39;t remember the last time I was very happy to be honest with you I don&#39;t remember  it&#39;s a  I don&#39;t remember it&#39;s been a long time  let&#39;s see my brother my older brother  he&#39;s a real positive influence in my life my best friend  she&#39;s a rub super positive person in my life every time I start talking negative or looking down on things she always reminds me be positive be positive and that helps a lot and she&#39;s there to encourage me and those two people right there or play a big role in my life  how do your best friend is  oh boy I have I think she probably describe me as  somebody that needs to take things more seriously when it comes to his health is spirituality life itself  somebody that has a lot of issues but yet she cares very much about  tell me about something you did recently  let&#39;s see something I&#39;ve done recently that I&#39;ve really enjoyed that I&#39;ve really enjoyed I enjoyed going over my brother&#39;s house and watching seeing him work on his Harley-Davidson he&#39;s building a Harley-Davidson from the ground up so I enjoyed going over there and seeing him get almost finished building this Harley from the ground up that was something I really enjoyed doing  nice  what are you most proud of  I guess it would  okay thank you  goodbye

Anything that you can do it up her to provide for their but it&#39;s a very hard job  that moment when your child tells you how much they care about you and my daughter her favorite things to tell me about I&#39;m her heart you know it I want to eat you make a call your name ages it&#39;s a sense of reality to be called Mama Ritz-Carlton call Dad and it is like it if I swear she also let you know that this is really I love you this is my life this is what I&#39;m living right now and  if a if I have a very good feeling that&#39;s the best part of being a parent  thank you  a lot of different things I&#39;m actually taking care of my daughter  I&#39;m here with her I was raised by my grandparents so I mean I didn&#39;t really get to know my mom since I was 16 and  my father I mean I couldn&#39;t Point them out or the street or sidewalk so I don&#39;t know who he is I feel that I&#39;m very different from them because no matter how hard the job is getting I don&#39;t give up  there&#39;s boob there&#39;s been a lot of different people that have been very positive in my life I can say my sister she was a good influence on me to get into the medical field she&#39;s in a lot of she&#39;s an LVN and she&#39;s one of my older sisters  I can say  me believing in God  being in my life God being in my life has also kept me strong enough to know that I don&#39;t have to take on This World by myself because God is there for me and  I don&#39;t know  I don&#39;t really like them to a lot of different people because  people are hateful  that&#39;s the most random thing that&#39;s in positive for me  are Liam outgoing I used to be shy coming up as a kid and I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what happened to me one day as it&#39;s broke out of my shell and I&#39;ve been  very accurate of showing my personality off  not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  what do you do to relax  I actually like four  the waves to collapse against the rocks at the beach and I like to just sit there  and the Zone everybody else out there  and rub my toes in the sand and that is so relaxing  how are you at controlling  give me some of that  I learned not to cuz it&#39;s a form of it&#39;s a form of knowing who&#39;s in control and is it your life for the someone else is and I feel that my temper me controlling my temper  are you showing it I&#39;m in charge of my life so I don&#39;t even let stuff get to me I don&#39;t even really remember the last time do I have to control back somebody because that&#39;s how much I try to block out the negativity  probably  fire daughter&#39;s father you know the dishes are physical altercation like what  okay  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  wow  I kind of feel guilty about helping like a recipe how things ended before my mom passed I wish that  I could have helped her a little more even though it people tell me not to feel bad because she was really there for me growing up but I kind of feel guilty like you know not being there as much as I could have been for her before she passed away so I think that&#39;s something that I still feel guilty for  okay  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  going through my mom passing away  I felt like I felt like  basically that  it was so kind of  Robinson&#39;s like I fell everyone else have parents and I grew up with my grandparents and then I&#39;m going to go so many years without actually going to Mom and Dad for me to get 18 years old and then then she leaves me it was kind of like  I don&#39;t know it was nerve-racking because  I felt robbed in Oleg I didn&#39;t have her all these years and then now that I&#39;m older and I don&#39;t even have right now  so  ever had  find me the paper of having a c-section when it was time for me to have my daughter I was so nervous so scared I really didn&#39;t know what to do I have to take it I mean like  that was so scared  I know the safest way of bringing my daughter into this world  are you happy  yes  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  card I didn&#39;t even sleep last night that&#39;s why I&#39;m yawning but  I kind of tend to  how to do everything and I have to get back to the stage word  I have to think about myself as well  can buy soap on  what are you like when you don&#39;t sleep well  a little like this but actually a little nicer today  groggy  okay  lately I&#39;ve been feeling very confident about being positive about going the extra mile of being a good parent  have you noticed any changes in her behavior  I actually really don&#39;t care what other people think anymore I used to let that bother me and I don&#39;t know more  no  also happy that my daughter is this world today on her birthday  Guinness no people  is there anything you regret  laughing moment  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  watch who I associate with  what are some things you wish you could change about yourself  my way  tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly  also my grandma  can you tell me if  okay  my daughter  my pride and joy  wow thank you bye  this is cool I need

382 trigger job on that  all right  okay KO  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  are you okay  sure  I&#39;m doing fine  I&#39;m from Columbia South Carolina  yep  2004  once a year for Christmas break  a lot slower paced  more  I wanted you to pursue a film degree or I&#39;m sorry I film career  are you still doing that yes  it&#39;s pretty challenging but it&#39;s fun  I&#39;ve always had an interest in film and movie so it seemed like a natural fit for me  took about a couple of years  bachata  I feel like I&#39;m pretty used to it now  I liked it doesn&#39;t snow it&#39;s warm weather and there&#39;s lots to do with a lot of beaches  show the traffic and the cost of living is pretty high  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I got much of a  I never been outside of the US but I would love to at some point  you can see yourself more shy  depends on the situation I can either be introverted or extroverted just given the right circumstance  okay  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  I know it&#39;s not polite but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  what are you doing  I like listening to music doing crossword puzzles reading and hanging out with friends on weekends  very good  I don&#39;t think it was an argument maybe about difference of opinion so is more like a debate but it was pretty pretty tame  I think it was a debate over Sports of a basketball game  and I was talking on Facebook with somebody about it  but I think it&#39;s good to express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it&#39;s it&#39;s natural to you know not always agree on things so I think talking about it is healthy  I have a very good relationship with my family I get along with all of my family members and extended no cousins and aunts and uncles so there&#39;s no one that I have ever had any risks with  with my family  I probably could have been more disciplined growing up and more  more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kind of thing  but for the most part I had a I had a good childhood and there&#39;s not much I would change about it  okay  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had  probably leaving my comfort zone and South Carolina moving out here that was pretty hard but at the same time it was exciting so it was it was a Bittersweet feeling  a lot of excitement mixed with some anxiety but it went away pretty quickly  sure  okay  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  not doing better in school when I was in high school  you&#39;ve done anything to avoid it  I definitely I could have been more diligent worker I could have applied myself a little bit better  I&#39;ve always had a strong family support system  and our parents and siblings so  that&#39;s definitely a positive thing  tell me about new bed or  event  probably going back to school I wish I would have  wish I would have done better in school so I could take something back from my past it would be scholastically related  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it&#39;s pretty easy  I don&#39;t sleep well  I tend to be kind of lackadaisical and just tired throughout the day kind of groggy  okay  have you noticed any changes in your butt  I know everything&#39;s pretty much the way it usually is with me  how did the feeling lately I&#39;m feeling pretty good  I know I have not  I know I haven&#39;t  first time I felt really happy  I made a lot of money a few weeks ago and I feel like I&#39;m ahead of the game with you know what having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so I&#39;m still kind of have the lingering effects for not happiness  yeah  when I  when I have money I tend to be a lot more even-tempered not even tempered but I tend to feel better about things and more optimistic and the city being such a about your finances if it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game and to have  dish have sources of income  I think I&#39;m creative  and I think I&#39;m a good listener  to be as disciplined and focused as possible  because once you&#39;re out of your parents homes and out of their lives you have to depend on yourself in the better the better you do in school in the better you are  as far as discipline concerned the more pleasure pleasurable your life will be in a lot your life will be a lot easier  let&#39;s see here  I wish I was more  disciplined but I&#39;m working on that and I&#39;ve gotten a lot better at that  it&#39;s become pretty easy I think I&#39;m just getting older I&#39;m I&#39;m out of my twenties now so I definitely seeing a change from when I first came out here  tell me about  some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kind of made me feel bad but I kind of take insults and stride and sometimes that welcome constructive criticism because something is wrong with either you&#39;re not aware of so as long as it&#39;s not mean-spirited it&#39;s coming from the right place I think it could be an invaluable tool you listening to what other people have to say that might be negative  probably optimistic and  outgoing optimistic and  helpful  find your ideal week  my ideal weekend I would love to go to Vegas and have a road trip with what three or four friends in a packed in the car and just lots of disposable income and you know good weather  when is the last time that happened  I haven&#39;t been to Vegas and probably 5 years but  I&#39;ve gone to casinos with my brother and it&#39;s pretty fun sometimes  I&#39;m proud that I&#39;ve come a long way from when I first moved out here I&#39;m a lot more disciplined I read a lot I do crosswords and I think I&#39;ve  I think I know it&#39;s important life now and I&#39;m more focused and going after what I want  I&#39;m not a big fan of high taxes  but it doesn&#39;t really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and  I guess I take it in stride though  I had a friend over at my apartment and I watch the movie now it&#39;s fun  it was a documentary  SI Sports  sure  goodbye  alrighty  cool  it&#39;s funny I would say something
471 okay thank you  yes  I&#39;m doing well thank you  from Los Angeles  sports Outdoor Sports mainly  surfing snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing  awesome awesome  traffic  yes  experiencing different cultures  well I love going to Mexico  and it&#39;s so much different from California and Western culture so to speak I know Mexico&#39;s a western civilization but the level of entertainment than the level of education is so much different than they&#39;re like two different worlds  traveling you mean  I would have to say going to an island off the coast of Fiji and the name is table Aurora and it&#39;s a very small island you can walk around in 30 minutes 30 or 40 minutes and it&#39;s a place where you go to go surfing and it is an incredible visually incredible and experientially incredible place  I studied biology  I was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and he wanted me to become a medical doctor also  not at all I&#39;m working in areas of business now  yes I am  my dream job would be to be a missionary  yes  my father&#39;s initial objective when he became an MD was to become a missionary and the he&#39;s a very generous person and I think I am too I guess I got that from him hereditarily but I would like to help people and I don&#39;t think being a doctor is helping people I really don&#39;t I think it&#39;s disingenuous to say you&#39;re helping people while you&#39;re stuffing wads of cash into your pocket I would like to be building people homes and helping them find fresh water sources things like that if I could afford to travel to remote places like that  screensavers  I know it&#39;s not  what are you  my exercise  I think I&#39;m pretty good at it. I think I&#39;m pretty effective at it  it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend and it was about her lack of consideration  I felt frustrated  a situation which I wished I could handle differently  in my later years I would say I don&#39;t have many regrets in my younger years I used to be snubbed by people and I would keep my mouth shut and I wouldn&#39;t say anything I would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior I would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings I&#39;ve learned that that is so wrong and so they&#39;ll probably the last 15 to 20 years I have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone&#39;s actions right away and that takes care of the anger immediately  yes say it depends what you mean by trouble I think all the way around once you take the beginning the beginning to the end it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble  going back it would be to not to pursue medicine like my father wanted we argued at length for many months and years about this and finally I prevailed and I didn&#39;t go to I didn&#39;t go that route but that was probably the most difficult. In my life  there was a time when I wished I could erase a female interactions girlfriends than and their betrayals but now I realize that keeping those memories make me who I am today and and dealing with them defines who I am today  oh my parents are deceased I had very good relationships with my parents I&#39;m very thankful for that even though my father was somewhat of a hard handed person we came to an understanding well before he died and my brothers I get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has psychological issues and they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that he&#39;s going through turmoil  well I guess I really don&#39;t cope with it because he&#39;s clinically depressed and he has Suicidal Tendencies and that he&#39;s not working he&#39;s very highly educated and he really doesn&#39;t talk to me and his family is very abusive towards him it&#39;s an I&#39;m not a happy relationship for his family  yes  I know I would have to say my father my father is my hero he&#39;s my model he&#39;s my archetype for what a man should be use unimpeachably honest and kind yet on the other hand he was he had high expectations of me and my two brothers  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  usually it wants my head hits the pillow I am dead asleep like a log but lately I&#39;ve been having just last night I couldn&#39;t sleep I woke up at 2 and I have a feeling it&#39;s because of a diagnosis of cancer that I received one month ago  with my own personal methods of handling stress I&#39;m okay I&#39;m probably 90% okay that 10% comes from a uninsured nurse about the future about whether I will survive this or not  not really  no  never  never  oh I was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking I always experience Joy when I&#39;m exercising at a very high level of exertion  funny jovial intelligent perfectionist  that&#39;s no one&#39;s asked me much about that maybe  to submerge my  hedonistic self  I look at it once again and my father feels my Consciousness he was the ultimate dufur of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that&#39;s what made him the self-made man that he was or as I am looking always for the present how I feel now and it&#39;s difficult for me to slog through a mile full of crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away  it would be  my ex-boss and he started using my last day of work when he fired me he started using a lot of profanity toward me and I turned to him and I said you cannot talk to me that way and he continue to use more profanity until I objected to it again and that&#39;s when he fired me and that still in my mind and that occurred a year-and-a-half ago  anything I regret oh yeah I regret not getting married and having kids  you&#39;ve done anything to a boy  sure I suppose I could but I think that  that would have robbed me of the many opportunities I had and I took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that&#39;s what I enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the United States is not the end of the world it is once you get to trouble you find out that we are not if we do not have the highest level of living in the whole world that other people think that we&#39;re the only ones that think that and I disagree  that&#39;s a good one I would say I would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it&#39;s going to end and I think I&#39;ve done that and I may be coming to an end soon with this diagnosis of cancer so I think I&#39;ve done I&#39;ve I&#39;m happy with my life thus far  I was giving a rock climbing lesson I have a part-time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me  I would say my  Devotion to the environment I wasn&#39;t always an environmentalist but I have been vocal in the cause of being a steward of the environment because today there are a lot of people people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic things like that and I stand up and I have been on TV and on YouTube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me and you&#39;re welcome  goodbye  it was interesting  okay
365 so she&#39;s going to chat with you for a bit I&#39;m actually before I do that okay okay  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in it safe  I&#39;m not a thing  are you okay  sure  I&#39;m doing alright  New Jersey  yes  3 months ago  not very often  how does it compare to LA  that&#39;s much different  I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just it&#39;s a lot more crowded here  to start a new life for myself  it wasn&#39;t very easy at all  it was quite rough at first but you know I&#39;m still trying to get used to a life here  I&#39;ve got some good friends here and I love the Hollywood area  I just did all of the mountains are beautiful kind of things I love  things you don&#39;t really  the traffic  not really know I don&#39;t  just haven&#39;t had the time or the finances to  okay  what you study  digital media  how did Judas  well life always love you know computers and you know designing things and I know it&#39;s kind of fell into it  are you still doing that no  I dropped off  well I guess my dream job would be working in something that I went to school for a night and never really completed my education  but I guess it&#39;d be great if I want you know back to school and you know it finished you know my degree in digital media and you know if finished started working you not doing something in that field  a little bit of both. I can be shy at times but  I like to push myself to be outgoing you know it&#39;s kind of a struggle for me but  I don&#39;t want to be you know in a shell so I can force myself to be outgoing  listen to music sometimes just drive and you know play music in my car and that helps me relax  or smoke a cigarette  like what  Stucky middle that&#39;s all I listen to is metal  awesome  well it depends on  how high my stress level is and how angry I am  but I I do my best to not get so pissed off  when was the last time you are  and  I don&#39;t know if she  she wanted me to come and pick her up  she&#39;s a little drunk  and we just kind of fought over the phone over some other things and  I just ended up not picking her up  because of her attitude on the phone with me  yeah it does  something I feel guilty about not talking to my kids often  or as often as I should  I&#39;ve just been so busy with trying to get myself all situated here that I I don&#39;t really have time to  you know talk to my kids as much as I&#39;d like to  you have no idea  it&#39;s it comes natural but it&#39;s snowy easy and it&#39;s it&#39;s the hardest job that I love to do  but right now it&#39;s extremely difficult for me because they live so far away and I made the choice to come out here to LA  and I feel bad that I don&#39;t see them you know  but  the reason I came out here was to better myself so I can provide for them  what&#39;s the hardest thing about being  fear you know  just fear what we need another if you&#39;re what&#39;s going to happen to your kids who fear  that something awful is going to happen  and not seeing them brings about that fear a lot more you know and I can&#39;t I can&#39;t always be there with them I can&#39;t see them you know it it wasn&#39;t as bad when I was living in Florida  and I at least needs to see them it wasn&#39;t very often but I still used to see them now I don&#39;t see them at all and that&#39;s the that&#39;s the hardest thing I&#39;ve had to do as a parent is to step away from my kids if only temporarily cuz I don&#39;t know how long we&#39;ll be here for  I don&#39;t know what my future holds  but the hardest thing is being so far away from them  I&#39;m sorry  the best thing about being a parent  the joy that they bring to me I mean I could be having a bad day and they just cheer me right up  I mean  it sucks being away from them for for so long and they&#39;re so far away and just not seeing their faces that&#39;s  it&#39;s the worst thing ever you know but  I love to just see their faces if they just bring a smile to my face and  well  I think the fact that I can get down to their level goofy or as a father than my dad was with me my dad was you no strict all the time she refused to let you know laugh and play with us but you know he was always very reserved you know and he kind of held back like a lot of emotions just because you know he was a he was a strong very tough guy but with me I&#39;m very goofy and silly like it that I&#39;m strict when I have to be  but I always love to be no playing around with them as much as possible you know not I don&#39;t want them to grow up too fast  but that may have been  well  situation that I wished I would have handled differently  there&#39;s so many  I guess what I was still with my ex-wife  in Florida I wish you wouldn&#39;t have gotten so angry or I wish I wouldn&#39;t have let her get the best of my emotions  she had a tendency to get underneath my skin and now you know keep picking at me until I exploded and I allowed her to do that  you know it I should have just walked away when I could  you know now that my temper get the best of me  no  no  no  how is your day  sometimes it&#39;s hard  sometimes I just lay awake in bed you know thinking all the things are going through my head all the you know all the stress that I&#39;m going through with work and Nino  making sure  I wonder if I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to be able to make you know rent you know one day when my kids are going through you know when I&#39;ll see them again if they even care about me anymore if they even know they have a father  you know those are some things that went through my head and  and it keeps me up at night sometimes  a little but you know I put myself in the situation so  you know I got up  bear with it and I got to  I know that you reap what you sow so lights  I got to deal with it in my own way  have you noticed any changes in your butt  lately I&#39;ve been trying to not think so much about  you know all that&#39;s going on in my life  I try to distract myself  the kind of  gets me in a better mood you know if I&#39;m hang out with my friends or just watch a little TV something to get my mind off you know all the stresses of my life  the last time I felt really happy  was I see a couple of nights ago I went out drinking with them  with a couple of my friends from work and  I don&#39;t know we just got pretty drunk and that kind of help me to forget all the crap that was previously gone through my head  so if I can distract myself I can forget about all that other stuff  but I&#39;m happy  some of my best qualities I guess I&#39;m convincing kind of like a I guess you would say a counselor to some people only answer my close friends I made talk people into doing things that they may regret or I&#39;m at I&#39;m going to try to talk people out of things that they and I may end up regretting or I may  you know just listen to people so you know I can see that you know I definitely know with my friends and help them out in their time of need when they&#39;re going through something troubling times like what I&#39;m going through  lips in Florida  you know I talk to him every now and then and he&#39;s been having troubles with his girlfriend and  you know I just kind of  talking about his problems to listen to I merely listen because you know I don&#39;t think he has anybody else to listen to you know when I was living in Florida I was very close with him so you know you can always rely on me and now that I&#39;m here in LA  I don&#39;t want to lose that you no connection with him because I mean I&#39;ve always been there for himself  he him your lies on me to listen to his problems and give him some advice in about what I think you know he should do  I think he appreciates that night and I&#39;m glad that he you never lies on me for that I that he trust me enough to tell me all that stuff  upgrade  what are some things you wish you could change about your  LOL  sometimes I wish I wasn&#39;t so kind or just rest  it seems bad but sometimes I don&#39;t people may take advantage of me and I may not realize it  and I don&#39;t like saying no to people I like  to always please people  so if I can change them I wish I wasn&#39;t such a people pleaser  and that gotten you in trouble  sometimes financially in trouble  sometimes I get annoyed  help others in that you know  that made me broke sometimes I may not have enough to  pay bills but I feel better helping people I don&#39;t know  I regret  nut  breaking up with my ex-wife sooner  Arie Arie  because she put me through so much crap in my life  and I&#39;m  I was wishing to be a people pleaser ocean to please her you know China  please my kids as much as I can but not breaking up you know the family  but  there&#39;s only so much one person can take  and I think probably if I would have left sooner  I&#39;m even happier and things may not have gotten so out of control out of hand like they did you know  during all those years with her  so if I would have got out sooner  I don&#39;t know my whip been happier by guess  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  it&#39;s okay to be selfish  it&#39;s okay to you know  think about yourself sometimes  you know if you keep putting everyone ahead of you  then you&#39;re not thinking about yourself you&#39;re nothing about what makes you happy  even though pleasing people make you happy  you have to think about yourself sometimes too in about your needs  because you know  you play an important role  in the lives of your close family members  and in order to keep everything afloat  you sometimes get up you got to worry about the one person that&#39;s you know juggling everything and holding everything up witches yourself so  be a little selfish sometimes it&#39;s okay  right  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  I don&#39;t even know what weekend is anymore  my ideal weekend would be  locked away alone in my room  watching movies listening to music just with my cell phone off and not going to be with anybody or could be out at a bar  you know you know watching a metal show  so I like to be alone  but at times I I do want to be out with that with others I like you know being around people  crazy  he thinks I&#39;m a I&#39;m crazy for coming out here  but I guess you would say that I&#39;m dedicated and then I&#39;m strong-minded  and that you know whatever I set my mind so I can do it you know no matter how hard it is I&#39;m not going to wimp out  so every night I really respect him for giving me his insight  but I guess yeah I guess you&#39;d say that  crazy butt  show my dick  my kids  yeah that&#39;s the one thing that brings joy to me you know her like real real Joy are my kids and  you know just having on my life is promised me I could never help us just having thumb  in my life  and although I don&#39;t get to see them as much  you want to think about those thinking about you know  how far they&#39;ve gone  you know what what they&#39;ve accomplished in their you know  in the short time we did it yeah it makes me happy and I can&#39;t wait to see them again  one of my most memorable experiences  I guess that would be  Florida  you know you want to Ciara and I fear band Skeletonwitch  it was it was a great night overall you know what was that I thought never forget it&#39;s because we&#39;ve been looking forward to it for you know somebody months and you know what it finally happened Alyssa real  it was a great night after all and overall  sure you&#39;re welcome  take that off
331 okay  all right  how about what she&#39;s at okay. Thank you  yes  okay  Connecticut  to be an actor  well I moved to San Francisco in 94 and then I moved to Atlanta in 96 and then I moved out here to be an actor and I became a realtor instead  I&#39;m to be on a TV show actor  it&#39;s pretty hard to get discovered and  you have to be lucky and you have to know the right people and you have to be talented  that really no I don&#39;t travel that much I used to move every couple of years to a different city and then I&#39;ve been here for a while so I don&#39;t travel  the weather there&#39;s always something to do and  that&#39;s pretty much it  the people here tend to be a little more rude and it&#39;s just always a fast pace  but when I moved here I was 25 so it was a lot more fun because when you&#39;re young in the city you can have a lot of fun and then I got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now I&#39;m old and I&#39;m not making any money so times are tough  no no I&#39;m not much of a more of an extrovert  when I don&#39;t get what I want and rude people and  just inconsiderate people  I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my temper when I&#39;m not like if I if I drink alcohol it&#39;ll make my temper go worse but when I don&#39;t drink I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my temper  the last time I argued with somebody was  somebody that owes me money  I live in West Hollywood  no no no I live alone I have a dog  it&#39;s good I mean I don&#39;t like my neighbors I hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that&#39;s good news hopefully the ones that move in or not that noisy and the ones below I just can&#39;t stand because they argue with  why because they cuz my hardwood floors they say that I&#39;ve been there for 10 years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors  yeah  what was the question  my mother has been a very positive influence she&#39;s always kept me on track she lived with me for the last 10 years until she recently moved to Rhode Island to live with my brother  very close to my mother not so close with my brother were close but we&#39;re not like close close so I mean we love each other we just don&#39;t really understand each other all the time  outgoing life of the party  ambitious  and sometimes Cut Throat  hum  do you always able to get through the things I need to get through to get to where I want to be  I&#39;m generous I&#39;m loyal I&#39;m friendly I&#39;m accommodating and  that&#39;s about it  no  yes  about 4 years ago  well I had was beating up and I had identity theft and you know I was just afraid to go out so I needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving that just depressed all the time I I said I have to get out and start talking to people and so I did  thank you  I&#39;m okay I&#39;m panicking about the job situation you know cuz my bills are pretty high and I don&#39;t really have a steady income right now  so that&#39;s what&#39;s worrying me the most is my financial situation  yeah I mean  well basically it&#39;s like I just recently quit drinking altogether so I don&#39;t drink anymore so I&#39;m noticing yeah I mean it&#39;s good cuz the number one I don&#39;t have the money and number two I don&#39;t like the way I act when I drink I&#39;m so so that&#39;s a positive thing but will the when I was drinking and help me just forget and numb myself now I have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good cuz I can talk my way through them so I guess I&#39;m evolving  oh yeah long time ago you know I&#39;ve taken many medications here and there and they really some of them would numb me some of them would make me feel hyper so I&#39;ve recently decided in the last 6 months 3 to 6 months just to not take anything so I don&#39;t take anything I barely even take an aspirin  to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state  not really  always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if I get in a car accident what happens if I can&#39;t pay my mortgage what happens if I eat just so many things I worry about and that&#39;s what was making me depressed  I do at some point I&#39;ve had some good therapist and I&#39;ve had some bad therapist I tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kind of give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen and then they just say okay your time is up so and just prescribed me medication so I think I&#39;d be better with a psychiatrist psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist  well I&#39;m not going to therapy now but  the therapy that I had before I was more like people trying to just come in and check in and give me medication I have had other therapy where I was back in the forest like okay well this is what I think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better  I just I wasn&#39;t getting the right therapist recently so and I knew that the root of my problem was the drinking cuz it&#39;s a depressant so  stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just a work through things myself you know  I can&#39;t really think of anything right now  it&#39;s been a long time I can&#39;t really think about a time when I felt really happy  okay when I was a kid I had a little dog and this big dog came in and attacked and killed it so then a little while later my father  came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there&#39;s two packages in the car so go get them so I was like yeah yeah yeah cuz I never listen to my parents like a spoiled brat to go to the car what&#39;s up  he said go to the car and get this out of the car so I finally went when I open the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that&#39;s one of my memorable experience  yeah cuz I&#39;m an animal lover so  just the way that I&#39;ve treated people before when I was hurting I was really mean or rude to people but I felt like you know I was hurting I had to hurt everybody around me so ever since I stopped drinking I don&#39;t do that anymore so I&#39;m  so I think the problem is is the drinking and so now that I&#39;ve let that go cuz I was doing it for the wrong reasons you know I was doing it to them not feel I wasn&#39;t doing it to be sociable  getting a career that is really stable like you know like a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising I should have gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it and sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don&#39;t go spend it on extravagant things  what I have a job when I when I&#39;m able to work when I&#39;m helping other people  what other people around me are happy and laughing when I can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood  okay thank you  you&#39;re welcome thank you  okay is this modeled after a real person or is it just like they just
425 all right  okay thank you  and please  are you okay with  yes  I&#39;m okay doing a little tired and worried  well I am looking for a place to live and I don&#39;t have a job right now so things are you sore a little  shaky for me  these days  where do you live I&#39;m staying with my son in Venice  it&#39;s pretty good but both of us need to have our own space so that&#39;s why I&#39;m looking for another place to live  originally from New York but I&#39;ve been in California since the early 70s  yeah  I moved to LA because I had been living in Portland Oregon and I was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seems like a good place to be  how easy was it for you to get used to living in LA  and it wasn&#39;t too hard I I met people right away and I just really liked it here so it was it was easy to connect with people  the weather is number one for most people I love being near the ocean I like the energy I like if they are like the artistic culture  well everybody loves the traffic and me loves the weather and hates the traffic so I kind of feel I feel the same way sometimes it gets a little wearing that it&#39;s so busy and the fact that it&#39;s so expensive makes it difficult  I see what you mean  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer  you travel a lot  I know not as much as I&#39;d like if if I had more and more income more friends I would travel more  I mostly have been  may I travel as let&#39;s say so my longest trips it was out of the country was to Mexico and I traveled drove down with a friend down to Oaxaca and the whole trip we took about about 4 weeks going down and back from the Bay Area  yeah that was a fun trip  well we&#39;ve been working together on the census and if she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her  from that trip I would say we were in Oaxaca for a Day of the Dead so it was celebrating Day of the Dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in at everybody in the village makes an altar in their house for their loved ones who have passed away and  they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that  I studied I was in the liberal arts program but I didn&#39;t stay stay only stay in school for in college for a couple of years but I was most interested in Liberal Arts and Humanities  dream job  my dream job would be personal assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to travel and go to events with them  how hot is it  it&#39;s hard to break into I&#39;m starting now very minimally with somebody who I&#39;m doing more of a volunteer work with and I&#39;m I&#39;m working on building up some of my skills so that I can be doing more of that  I&#39;m fairly I&#39;m kind of a friendly introvert so you know I have no trouble meeting people I don&#39;t hold back and you know I just am not like shy at parties I&#39;ll go up and talk to people but I am over all kind of introverted so  I prefer one-on-one then big groups  I like to watch I like to watch improvement shows like HGTV I like to watch  I agree model shows and and see Transformations or watch movies or read I play some Solitaire on my my Kindle Fire  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  I don&#39;t usually realize I&#39;m mad until later it doesn&#39;t really come up and I just tend not to have the kind of life where  those situations arise us sometime soon of sometimes on the road I get a little annoyed I don&#39;t get annoyed so much I like when people cut me off or anything like that but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or  you know it when they get angry because maybe I&#39;ve done something inadvertent nail cut them off by mistake and you know like they get really angry then that makes me angry and return  When was the last time you argue with  yeah I like I said I don&#39;t really get into arguments  I did have I was with a friend the other day and  she got annoyed with me because she felt like I was correcting her  so it wasn&#39;t really an argument but she  I had said something that she heard as a correction while it was a correction and she got angry  well then I felt criticized and I felt I felt vulnerable I wasn&#39;t it was it was pretty uncomfortable  well in that situation I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t have to correct her  so  I think that&#39;s something I&#39;m starting to look at in myself is my need to be right  so in general that&#39;s I&#39;m trying to to catch that and just let people  make mistakes with without my telling them about it  I don&#39;t know  that&#39;s Tuff  I can&#39;t know that I&#39;ve had that much trouble making decisions  well  hard for me to decide to put my cat to sleep when he was sick  oh it was and I had to give up a cat  and I was moving once and and that was difficult to  well in the case of the first cat the one that was sick  I decided when the vet said that he thought it was the Humane decision  and with cat I had to give up I didn&#39;t I  didn&#39;t really decide I was moving to a place that where I couldn&#39;t take her  and so I thought I found somebody who could take her  say that stuff  I don&#39;t really have that the erasing from the memory part  there&#39;s nothing I really wish I could erase from my memory  trying to think of something that I&#39;ve done that I  wish I hadn&#39;t done  oh okay I remember something they were there was a time when I was I was in a class at Junior College it was a film class and I was I was the one who was after we we went out and did a little film project  and we&#39;re supposed to bring it back into class the next week I was the one who had the film and through different just things that were happening in my life right now and never went back to the school but I never brought them to film back so all the work they have done I had to do over again and I still feel bad about that  but it&#39;s pretty easy sometimes I wake up in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that&#39;s not very often  how to concealing lately  I&#39;ve been feeling kind of tired and low-level depressed like not feeling a lot of options  no  yes I have  oh there were two times there was once back in like 1970  290 about 1972 or 3 and then  another time  oh so then would that have been in bed 16 years ago  just feeling like there wasn&#39;t  you know feeling the feeling that things weren&#39;t going to change  if I didn&#39;t get some help and that if I  I didn&#39;t have to let you know that maybe if I got some medication that would help me  and the short-term  I&#39;m not going to therapy right now  Travis moving around alot finances there wasn&#39;t really feeling the need starting to think it might be an option again  I feel like therapy can be useful  well when I went to therapy  it was helpful to have somebody who listened and could also  offer impartial suggestions for helping me to improve the way I was feeling  I was on the beach last weekend was beautiful day and I was sitting in the sun and just relaxing I had my notebook can I was doing some writing and I felt very happy and content  I&#39;m kind and compassionate and I&#39;m a good listener  and I&#39;m intelligent and I have five good ideas  well I wish that  sometimes I wish I was a harder worker I&#39;m not really willing to take  low-wage jobs even though  I need work so I just don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m willing to do anything  and  I wish I could act as I said I had good ideas I have good ideas and I&#39;m good at the the onset but I&#39;m not really good on the follow-through so a lot of those ideas get started but then I don&#39;t take them the distance that&#39;s probably the the thing I&#39;d like to change my myself the most  10 or 20 years ago I&#39;d give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree  finish my education  and be willing to  to work a regular job and two  to start putting money away for my retirement  what are you most proud of in your life  proud of my children and I am proud of the friendships I have and I&#39;m proud that  that  people people do admire me and value my opinion  goodbye goodbye  okay  okay  thank you
350 virtual human she&#39;s in chat with you for a bit okay  okay  okay  are you okay  yes  how do I find thank you  originally I&#39;m from well I was born in Mississippi so I&#39;m from Gulfport Mississippi  yes  I didn&#39;t have a choice I was a child I moved here with my parents  when I was 2 years old  if I was I was a toddler  yeah if I like to travel and I travel a lot  being around new environments and new people different things  well one of my favorite trips was visiting Africa and I think 2006 I visited West Africa that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and give medical assistance to people  a friend of mine was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so I went with her and it went from there so I don&#39;t know I made the decision that way  I am I am happy I did that it&#39;s something I&#39;ll never forget  I studied English and education so that I could teach high school students  not currently no  well right now I tutor privately for private Tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher  wow anything that combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so tell anything I can buy and sell those three items so teaching has the closest I&#39;ve come to that  okay  occasionally f  I don&#39;t know I guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing and and a lot of people have said I seem reserved our kind of introverted I don&#39;t know  well  I don&#39;t know I read them I just started meditation  try to breathe and calm down  things that make me really mad  mistreatment of children  abusive children  try to figure out what&#39;s annoying me usually and then go from there if I can control not being annoyed by ultimately I control that whether or not I&#39;m annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not being if I can help it at all  no I&#39;m fine. Control tank at controlling my temper I think so I don&#39;t have  the last time I argue with someone  I was  I don&#39;t know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about  it was about a smell they had on their clothes but I thought it smelled like perfume and they said and did not  of course I think I&#39;m very close to my family we&#39;re pretty close-knit family talk everyday see each other most everyday  there been a lot of positive influences in my life I would say my aunt and definitely my mother have all been positive influences  more about that  well I look look up to my eye I think she&#39;s positive I look up to her because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and area is and she&#39;s very successful despite the types of things that we&#39;ve gone through as children and she doesn&#39;t let her pass to find her future my mom&#39;s overcome so many obstacles as well and she has some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she still tries to  no overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so I look up to people who are able to know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible  military no I have not  no  I have  well I was diagnosed with in the last year and then again most recently within the last 3 months  well fear and just not knowing what to do with some of the things I was feeling and not knowing  you know why I couldn&#39;t stop feeling the way I was feeling  there were a lot of symptoms on  you know mostly I gained a lot of weight I couldn&#39;t sleep a lot and then sometimes I could sleep too much  so sad sometimes  like I want to cry a lot  feeling okay I&#39;m more days you have I don&#39;t know every day is different so I mean today I feel fine but like I said everything&#39;s differently and lately I&#39;ve been feeling more like I command them involved in my own life and like I want to get  thousand do more things  no no no not any different from before what I was experiencing before  no  well I was receiving  I got a Psychotherapy and I don&#39;t know a lot of things happened I moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and I just kind of got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while  but sometimes  I do yes it is  it&#39;s kind of difficult I either have a hard time falling asleep or hard time staying asleep  I&#39;m sure it is I just don&#39;t know what it is as of yet because I usually had some thoughts continue with thoughts running through my mind. Either keep me up or make it hard for me to go to sleep or I&#39;ll make it hard for you to stay asleep  journal sometimes that might help if I can write something down and get it out that helps  other than that I don&#39;t know haven&#39;t found any really great way to coping  Tire  mostly tired  kind of confused  I don&#39;t know for the most part I feel happy it&#39;s just I&#39;m  last time I felt really happy was I guess over the holidays  I&#39;d love to hear all about it  I don&#39;t know I guess just being around family and friends just the holiday season I guess in general that&#39;s just a happy time for me and some people I haven&#39;t seen in awhile  talk about it  call my best friend describe me probably as  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes tenacious I don&#39;t know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because I&#39;m caring and compassionate are easy to talk to  that I might him over so I can sister to them  everyone has regrets I&#39;m sure yeah I guess so  to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and I don&#39;t mean to sound that way but it&#39;s true is just we have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you I&#39;m to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you&#39;re supposed to be doing at that time it doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their their time and their progression to how they get two things so I would tell me 10 years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that I want from my life and don&#39;t be  I&#39;m really enjoyed working with okay that&#39;s fine project with my younger relatives my cousin&#39;s we did a science project together and that was fun despite the mess we made those ball  being the first to attend college in my family and then I&#39;m going to college and coming back to the community where I went to school and then teaching and not community and volunteering in our community and helping youth or children that come from the same background that I came from so I&#39;m most proud of being able to  to have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and  help someone else improve them better themselves as well  I think I got everything on YouTube  your pie  that is really cool
640 okay  okay  okay  okay so I&#39;m just going to answer whatever she says that she will eat everything  so she&#39;s going to ask you some questions and then when she&#39;s done you&#39;re going to press you to say goodbye and then you&#39;re going to press this button  okay  hi  I&#39;m pleased  okay  yes  I&#39;m doing good  where you from  Brooklyn New York  Sun weather  a lot of people the beach  some of the people  you travel a lot I like to whenever I can I&#39;m a big fan of traveling  visiting new places meeting other people eating different food seeing other cultures that kind of stuff  I went to Spain recently and that&#39;s a little bit of a more laid-back lifestyle they don&#39;t work the same hours As Americans different culture they take a lot of breaks rests during the middle of the day especially in the summer when it&#39;s really hot totally different food style culture they go out to bars and restaurants a lot later stays open later and you know something new exciting and you know I look forward to seeing other types of destinations like that  going to Spain with the all my old high school friends I hadn&#39;t seen them in a while and we did a big tour of Spain went to Madrid Barcelona Valencia had a great time you know spent a couple weeks out there and  I am catch a relaxing and have fun  how is a computer science major  you know I do it Consulting  dream job probably I want to I want to start moving into Finance I want to do something financial-related investment-banking I think I&#39;m going to switch course pretty soon here  I&#39;m a little bit more shy  my family is good we&#39;re a little bit closed we don&#39;t we don&#39;t show a lot of emotion and we&#39;re not is as loving you know over the phone or in person but you know we have other ways to show our emotions  yeah  I usually I&#39;ll just watch a movie or go to the movies go to the park I have a small dog so I like taking him around the block so that they usually relaxes me a bit  how are you  I&#39;m usually pretty good I don&#39;t really get extremely angry very often and I keep a lot of my emotions inside which isn&#39;t always good but you know I never have crazy angry outbursts and get violent or anything like that  when was the last  the last time I argued with someone was a few weeks ago we are actually in Las Vegas and you know we were with a big group of people and we are just trying to decide where to go and one of my friends was pretty adamant about one place and it was unappealing to the rest of the group so you know I got a little confrontational but everything worked out in the end  tell me about  I think the passing of my my mom&#39;s dad I wish I would have been a little more loving and an emotional to my mom about it you know it was a very difficult time for her friend  I should have been there a little bit more than I was  I feel guilty about just not being as as loving and caring to my parents I mean they&#39;ve they&#39;ve done a lot for me and provided a lot and I don&#39;t know he&#39;s really show my appreciation to them I think as much as I wish I should so  tell me about the hardest decision  the hardest decision I ever  something that I wish was erased would certainly be when I was pulled over for a DUI very embarrassing moment but you know I wish that it never happened  have you ever seen  how have you been feeling lately  I&#39;ve been a little bit sad I had another death in the family recently my uncle passed away a couple weeks ago so it&#39;s been a little bit difficult on all of us and you know we&#39;re all spread out around the country so it&#39;s  stuff we can&#39;t really you know be together in person so  makes it difficult  how do you notice  I just recently I mean I think I&#39;ve been a little a little more bummed out and  you know down a little bit more than you know normal so you know I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll turn around soon but some of these things just take time to heal  tell me more about that  well you know whenever you lose someone close to you in a family you know it&#39;s very difficult for everyone and the you know different people show their emotions differently so you know for me I tend to keep a lot of it in and then I&#39;ll be a little more beneficial if I was able to express it to someone more but you know I don&#39;t really feel comfortable doing that all the time so  hopefully things get better  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep it&#39;s very difficult cuz I work a lot of strange hours to so I&#39;m up in a working late and then got to get up early and sometimes I can sleep in more so you know if I&#39;m not in a set routine it makes it a little more difficult but you know I usually get a decent amount of sleep as often as possible so I usually don&#39;t have too much trouble in that sense  what are you  fell asleep while I&#39;m usually a little just bit more irritable more grumpy you know smaller things can set me off a little bit but you know I have certain techniques to relax a little bit more so you know whenever that happens I&#39;m I&#39;m usually able to handle myself appropriately  have you ever been diagnosed with  no  no  when is the last time  the last time was probably about three weeks ago when I was in Las Vegas visiting some friends and had some other friends come out to visit that I hadn&#39;t seen in a while so that was a fun happy time for the weekend  my dad is always been you know of a good role model to me professional and you know I always been there regardless of what I&#39;ve been going through so I certainly look up to him and appreciate everything he&#39;s done for me  he would describe me as being pretty social outgoing but a little bit more shy and reserved so you know friendly caring honest and unreliable  great  what&#39;s something you did  something that I recently did that they enjoyed was completing a big project for someone I built a large website that have been a big project for a while and it&#39;s been taking up a lot of my time so finally getting that finished and taken care of was a big relief and weight off my shoulders  nice  what are you most proud of in your life  most proud of my family they&#39;ve always been there for me I&#39;ve gone through a lot of tough times when I was younger and you know they&#39;ve always been there to support me and that&#39;s really meant a lot so that&#39;s really kept me going yeah I&#39;ve got great friends around me as well but he&#39;ll family first and you know they&#39;ve always been there when I needed them  thanks for sharing your thoughts  are you
444 yes I&#39;m doing very well today I feel good today  Borden Indiana grew up in Bloomington  I moved to LA for a job working with the CDC  I&#39;ve only been back twice in the past 20 years  my family is not there anymore I went back for high school reunions  it&#39;s much Greener it&#39;s very green a very small  very young  wooded areas before I played in the woods when I was a kid we summon the corries I rode my bicycle everywhere and here it&#39;s a little more cement in traffic  it was it just seemed like cement at first but I loved it now and I have friends and I love being able to do so many different things and I go to the beach a lot I took up to the mountains I go camping all the time so I I love it I love it always opportunities  I have traveled quite a bit I was in the Peace Corps and I was in South America is in Paraguay for 3 years and I traveled all three South America Brazil Peru Chile Bolivia on a suspended year in London travel through Europe and I used to go to Canada often I&#39;d love to get to Asia one of these days  meeting new people at the food I love trying new food in just getting a different perspective on the world and different people&#39;s outlook on the world  and because America tends to become isolated  I hike the Inca Trail when I was in Peru that was a 5 Day hike starting out of Cusco we hiked for 45 days and woke up went the last morning at the sun gate of Machu Picchu and that was just in the most amazing experience cuz I don&#39;t need I&#39;d seen about seen it in National Geographic you know all my life so to be there and experience that was phenomenal  awesome  philosophy of mint green philosophy I minored in art and business and I got very disenchanted with it very quickly and so I decided to study what I wanted to study while I was in college and had the opportunity so that&#39;s what I wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can&#39;t get a job as a philosopher that I had the idea of getting My Philosophy degree then going to law school and being a professor of Ethics but that kind of fell apart and that&#39;s actually how I ended up joining the Peace Corps so it all worked out  I&#39;m sorry  yeah  I&#39;m sorry my alarms going off on my phone it&#39;ll die in a second okay inside still going  sorry I turned off the phone but I forgot to turn off the alarm  Mexico  okay I&#39;m sorry what was the question  my dream job gosh  writing I&#39;ve done a few scripts and screenplays with a friend of mine but I don&#39;t really want to do it the Hollywood thing but writing in teaching  and traveling if I could do that overseas  are going  turn turn off my alarm  I can&#39;t move okay I can&#39;t get to my first okay I&#39;m sorry yes  I forgot it&#39;s time to go to yoga class  I&#39;m terribly sorry about that  sorry for the interruption  I have an actual fish tank at my house tonight I do the same thing and I do that with my children when they get upset that I put them in front of a spanking is very relaxing I also try to meditate I try and and just sit down and be quiet and gather my thoughts I&#39;d like to read and are sometimes I walk I&#39;ll take my dog for a walk  I wish I could say I was good at it but usually I I tend to have outbursts every once in awhile when things are getting too chaotic at my house and I am feeling very underappreciated I will have a burst of anger  yeah my husband doesn&#39;t appreciate that and I&#39;ve never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family I&#39;ve done it and then instead of recognizing that I&#39;m sad about it my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad and then that escalates and sometimes I just end up walking out the door  or going to my room  I&#39;m sorry  I usually after I have an outburst and I isolate myself for a little bit I can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner  I&#39;m sometimes it&#39;s very hard. I&#39;ve gotten to the point where I know just to stop in and get myself out of there and then go take some deep breaths and then really try and figure out what I&#39;m feeling why I&#39;m being angry why why am I being so tense  and then be able to verbalize that  well it happens a few times when I start getting it had a very tense day and things haven&#39;t gone right I tend to have Outburst in the kitchen while I&#39;m making dinner and the kids are all home and they&#39;re asking me questions about their homework or they&#39;re turning on the TV or and my husband&#39;s are bothering me about things that I just don&#39;t need to think about right then and one time I just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and I just it just had more pressure building up in building up and actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove really hard just like get people to pay attention to what I was saying and actually made a dent in my stove which is still there so that&#39;s that I should have  walked out sooner and taking my deep breaths before I did that  it was probably when I was pregnant with my first child  I wasn&#39;t married  I had a very good friends so I was I was 32 at the time so I was you know it wasn&#39;t young I think if I was younger I probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life I&#39;m like okay I&#39;m going to have this child  and I had got pregnant by the man I actually married and still married to but we&#39;d only been dating like 3 months and I was living with a good friend of mine who had been in the Peace Corps with and she in so I didn&#39;t know this guy very well I didn&#39;t know if we could raise a child together I didn&#39;t know if I wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else and my friend suggested that we raise the child together even suggested moving to Costa Rica to raise the child together and so I was a lot of  huge decisions that we&#39;re going to determine the rest of my life  and I made the decision based on  more common sense and practicality  but I don&#39;t regret that decision I think I made a good decision  to marry my husband and raise our child  and they&#39;re older now my my oldest is 17 he is at DaVinci Science school and he&#39;s very much into engineering he is getting his pilot&#39;s license which I&#39;m very proud of them for the my daughter is 15 and she loves acting she she has a boyfriend who they see just once a week at church basically and they text each other constantly she&#39;s a very very typical 15 year old and then I had a 12 year old he is extremely active and is in constant motion and always making noises but I love him dearly he is into rock climbing and there&#39;s a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis  no I find it extremely difficult I wasn&#39;t my mother had a varied if my dad died when I was young and my mother kind of disconnected when that happened so I didn&#39;t have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and I basically raised myself I was kind of on my own from a very young age I mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so I really didn&#39;t have parenting skills that you know most people are are raised with I know what not to do but sometimes it&#39;s very difficult and I see my friends that has you know these  very innate parenting skills is very warm and you know they&#39;re making cookies and everything&#39;s organic and they know everything and know their house is always perfect and it&#39;s like I&#39;m just not that person so I I I Tried &amp; B I think I am a very good mother but I&#39;m not a typical mother I think I&#39;m more and more creative a lot of times and we do a lot of things but it&#39;s not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing  actually when we go camping it&#39;s more I&#39;m more homey when I go camping then I am at home I think I&#39;m more tense when I&#39;m at home  but I&#39;m trying to factory meditation and things if that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to become  calmer and more patient I think my patience is what I need to work on the most  and they&#39;ve been an insomniac all my life I remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and I haven&#39;t slept well for a long time but I realize that if I exercise and I do something with my brain intellectually during the day I have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well and that&#39;s sometimes that&#39;s hard to do and so loud house I stayed stay awake beating I&#39;ll read till midnight and then I&#39;ll try and go to sleep and usually I don&#39;t get back up even if I wake up at 3 again and things of that sort. I&#39;ll try to go back to sleep  yesterday I didn&#39;t feel so good I was I think a lot of it has to depend on the weather and was all cloudy and gray yesterday cuz I plan to when you&#39;re done working in my garden and then I&#39;m making a butterfly garden in my front yard so I had some more planting to do and I just cooked in kind of feel like doing it so hard to put out about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but today I feel really good  I feel more positive I feel more energy  I don&#39;t know I just got a new mattress actually that hasn&#39;t really help me sleep but it was really good because I&#39;ve needed one for a really long time and I was just kind of excited about being to get delivered in and set up and in that sounds like so mundane but it was you know just like I&#39;m finally doing something positive cuz it&#39;s it&#39;s something that I put off doing and put off doing put off doing and it was like finally there in concrete and it&#39;s like I&#39;ve done this task that I can check off my list but also I took the kids camping over on spring break and we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and around the campfire and making some more as and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy  I don&#39;t know I think she believes that I&#39;m  more intellectual and smarter than I think that I am at times so she comes to me with a lot of issues she always she always listen to advice remains she thinks I give her good advice and when she doesn&#39;t know what to do so I shall ask me and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by just like to complain about because I&#39;m sympathetic or empathetic and I just I&#39;m just there to listen and I don&#39;t need to give her any advice so I think it&#39;s a good listener in  I procrastinate a lot  I start projects and I don&#39;t finish them so that&#39;s what I&#39;m working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that I started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and I&#39;m very enthusiastic about them when I when I start them and I&#39;ll get almost finished and then I don&#39;t know what happens I just completely lose interest sometimes I think it&#39;s because I&#39;m afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but  I&#39;m working on that  to get this done  oh gosh  not following through on the opportunities I had when I got out of the Peace Corps there was a lot of things that I could go and try to go on to get my Master&#39;s Degree what are the grants and things so that&#39;s where it but instead I got pregnant got married and I had a wonderful job that I really liked and really enjoyed but then when I got pregnant the second time is right at a time where I had to fight for a directorship and I realized my limitations where I I couldn&#39;t be pregnant and have this child and and do everything I needed to do to get a directorship and so I really wish so I resigned and I wish I had stuck with that cuz then I would have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding in  solid career  not base decisions on emotions sometimes I am and not I have some really bad bosses the jobs were wonderful but my ego got in the way  and I would have told myself to let go of that aspect of the job that goes the the egotistical reactions that I had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well  my children actually and also my Peace Corps experience was just phenomenal and people are actually really interesting that they were like an all that they actually know someone who actually did that so that that&#39;s why I always when I was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the Peace Corps when it first started and I always said I want to do that one day I want to do that one day I want to do that one day and I finally got to the point where I don&#39;t have to shut up or do it so that&#39;s  that was one of my powdered experiences  okay  thank you

400 all right  thank you  are you okay with this  yeah  I&#39;m fine  Pacific Grove California  the wholesale opportunities and all the stores and anything I could ever ask for  the traffic is the mood of the people and the unhealthy pace  I would see I did like culinary and I did really good in art and music  in high school  through my own will and desire to want to get involved with the music  no  open up a health practice of some sort  what made you decide to do that  changing things in my life that had an impact on myself and others for the for the benefit of Health  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes  do you travel  when I have the opportunity  buying things seeing the culture relaxing not thinking about the city  well yeah I used to go to Texas every every year with my dad during the summer and I always wanted to stay there and live there when I went on vacation  most likely one of these trips to Texas where we would go and spend time in the desert shoot guns and ride go-karts and stuff like that  it was  I&#39;ll see y  my dad and I are not really talking that much and my mom Dust Away about 2 months ago  I&#39;m sorry to hear that  thanks  definitely Marsh I always been that way  I just a personality that I&#39;ve grown into but learning how to adjust the sensitivity and grow out of it  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  teen  eating I like to eat that make that calms me down  not that good when I get really upset that it&#39;s usually a problem and I have to work to come myself down and sometimes I just don&#39;t get on something and I don&#39;t stop  sometimes but I&#39;ve learned to control it to that extent now  when was the last time you  yesterday I was arguing about what&#39;s what kind of water we should be drinking  oh well a difference of opinion and I felt as though my opinion was very valid even though the other party&#39;s opinion was somewhat misinformed  definitely everyday is growing process I wish I would have handled everything differently every day which is what makes me grow and I tried to work toward, it would have wanted to handle things everyday little by little  okay  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to  can&#39;t think of anyone right now  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  find I&#39;d I&#39;d say not supporting my friends as much with their career choices  I&#39;d rather not get into it  the raw food Educators on YouTube and raw vegan Educators and the detox therapy therapy experts have been really inspirational in the past 2 months  well that they believed that the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like T Colin Campbell The China Study the sources of information that are that are very good and I think deserve respect based on you know real research  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep really easy I&#39;ve almost got it down to a science  what are you like when you don&#39;t say  I&#39;m tired  I&#39;m feeling better than I have in a long time  oh yeah I think it&#39;s due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that&#39;s actually you know losing them talks and some things that I&#39;ve accumulated over my short lifetime of you know toxic choices with Food and Drugs or whatever it would be  yes I&#39;m less tense and less irritable and I have more clarity and more control over my  decisions in my wants versus what I need that sort of thing  nope  yes to some extent  our 5 years ago  lack of motivation and  basically make my symptoms were paralleling that of depression  loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear of social situations and the main for 5  no  I believe I overcome to chapter in my life that was the the doctor you know taking control my health and experimenting with drugs and I just sort of took another route which was alternative and I started juicing more and just trying to listen to maybe what I needed with help of the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that  yes  can you tell me if  I believe therapy is useful because  without looking inward or having somebody to help you to that it&#39;s very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just resume in the subconscious and tell you you know it has an outburst is basically therapy will help an overall health and mental health I believe fairy  last night I made a really great vegan dinner with no meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot of almost converted them  I would say  you know I&#39;m trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar or as you know my body needs something other than that  apple  it&#39;s very very hard it&#39;s a daily process  tell me about a time when someone made you feel really bad  I was handling money for a business partner and they ended up short and I was to blame but it was actually my formula crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change I make the formula so the blame is on me that I may have took money and I automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy my uncertainty to the change of formula  is there anything you regret  no  20 years ago I was two years old 10 years ago is 12 years old I would tell myself to  to start eating raw fruits and vegetables everyday  as calm and  sad maybe smart talented  I really enjoyed going to the Wholesale Food Market in downtown Los Angeles  can you tell me about that  lots of food at great prices you can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price is going to a normal supermarket  so I really get a lot of enjoyment of teaching people how to maybe better themselves especially food-wise what they&#39;re eating  what are some things that usually put  eating and I&#39;m watching a really good TV show  okay  I&#39;m insightful I cannot I can adjust to people  I don&#39;t know I guess I&#39;ll skip that question for now  I&#39;m most proud of  that&#39;s in my overall situation with where I&#39;m at right now I could have never imagined that I&#39;d be in such a fortunate situation  that&#39;s so good to hear  because I want everything I need  sharing your thoughts with me  I think she&#39;s done
604 I passed out to make sure that our audio recognition system is working so if you could just say  1 2 3 4 5  virtual human for justice  does she have a name  I&#39;ll pray to speed dating I&#39;m 604 my name is Justin  and you catch everything was only home and I wasn&#39;t even thinking about that  the Perfect Mate  okay  okay  okay  yes  doing okay I&#39;m a little tired  Los Angeles  text  hum I like  maybe the smog the traffic  I don&#39;t really buy that too much  not really  fair enough  narcissistic people  self entitled people  what do I do when I&#39;m annoyed I usually  think about the situation and see if I&#39;m really annoyed or if I&#39;m just having a  I&#39;m pretty good most of the time I don&#39;t think I get angry often  I think it was I was arguing with my girlfriend about moving out  Theater Arts  what do you do now I&#39;m an actor  I don&#39;t know  yeah  not as often as I&#39;d like  I don&#39;t know how to answer that  I&#39;m pretty close with my family  my dad  what do you want to know  it&#39;s okay  I do not  I have not  no I haven&#39;t  tired exhausted but mostly good  I can be  a little short but I think that&#39;s just due to being tired  no this is been busy lately  can you tell me about  like what  no not down not depressed just  tired  not easy lately but I think after this week I&#39;ll be able to get better sleep  a little more cranky than normal a little more introverted  hum  I don&#39;t remember  on the fact that I don&#39;t remember  loyal creative likes you know extroverted  not really  no problem  goodbye  yep  no problem
314 don&#39;t I look gorgeous you straighten up a little bit here  okay now you&#39;re going to chat with her for a bit  okay  yes  quite well I feel good  Los Angeles California here  one of the few native-born Los angele ins  I homeschool my ten-year-old son and I&#39;m a homemaker I have five children and married 22 years  about the full-time job  somewhat we can we went to Israel about two months ago for a pilgrimage with our church yeah so I would say yes I&#39;ve traveled a bit  I will most recently we like 2 months ago we went to Israel for a pilgrimage we were gone about nine days and was fabulous it was we spent the first five days in Corazon which is near the Galilee and in a place called I mean the name of the area is causing but we stayed in place called The domus galilaeae which is  a house for that welcomes Christian pilgrims as well as Jewish pilgrims  I enjoy like really the most important I dress like meeting the people and and of course seeing that the history especially Israel amidst the totally ancient but most dangerous is the the people I think to get a better understanding of how different cultures  live  no not at all  just don&#39;t I have all my life I&#39;ve always been  open and and willing to socialize and I remember my younger brother I was joking saying that I would talk to anybody and I will I&#39;ll talk to just about anybody just because I enjoyed learning about other people  most of the top five by the end of the day after I&#39;ve cooked dinner and we&#39;ve had dinner together as a family I there&#39;s a word game on the computer that I like to play for a little while and then watch TV have a cocktail with my husband and just relax that&#39;s what we do and you know because we have a lot going on we don&#39;t stay up too late song  like to watch crime dramas  really mad probably not a lot  I get frustrated with for example my daughter does not clean up her room almost ever so that that gets me angry but  in terms of like really getting like heated Langer I mean other than like little things that my children do you know especially my oldest child is 21 you know he can be confrontational cell  other than that nothing really gets me like really angry  haven&#39;t I have haven&#39;t felt that  contributing to society helping  helping to raise responsible people I guess  and of course the love and affection in the the sun and the excitement that goes with it and all the stages that go I mean like really right now I&#39;m in a stage where my children are either adults or teenagers I only had I have one 11 year old and the rest are all teenagers and adults so it&#39;s really fun because we&#39;re able to talk about current events and all kinds of stuff that&#39;s going on in the world and you know have to have a challenging discussions and that sort of thing so it&#39;s it&#39;s a different level than when you&#39;re taking care of babies and you know changing diapers and that kind of stuff  the hardest thing is that it&#39;s 24/7  you never not a parent you know it&#39;s and so you have to accept that and that&#39;s I remember when I first with my first child thinking you know when I brought him home from the hospital this is it I mean there&#39;s no going back you cannot change I mean I guess you could if you did something horrible but I mean the normal circumstances you can&#39;t change that and it&#39;s a permanent thing and  it is in some ways it takes away your freedom but in other ways it gives you a different sort of freedom  always  I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t get what you said  some of the things that have been a positive influence in my life most importantly my church and my face but also my husband he&#39;s been a really  he&#39;s kind of his very like logical thinking and very grounded so if I get emotional or I get upset about something he&#39;s always we balance each other out likewise if he gets upset about something I&#39;m able to balance him out so it&#39;s been it&#39;s been a great gift in my life  I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be categorized as somebody with a temper occasionally I occasionally I get angry but I don&#39;t like have like rarely do I have outbursts I&#39;m more more likely to you know to say what I feel not let it build up so you don&#39;t like my husband and I don&#39;t  rarely fight like have arguments that are yelling and screaming or anything like that it almost never happens because I like I said I&#39;m more of a type of person that communicates on the spot self I&#39;m thinking something I usually communicate it right away instead of letting it build up  usually I&#39;m arguing with my older son because he you know he thinks he knows everything he&#39;s 21 years old so he has the know-it-all mentality and I&#39;m just telling him that he doesn&#39;t know it all and you know I was like was on Hiller and more and he&#39;s very confident and very self  cell phone with the ra self-assured and so he thinks that you know everything he does is correct and he still has a lot of learning to do that&#39;s all  it is a can be  I think that many of them are spoiled and living environment of  of instant gratification which I think is going to be detrimental to the to the future of this country but  in a given that with all the technology we have is really not any way to go back so I I have hope that they will I mean I think this country was built on hard work and an ethics and hopefully our art the Next Generation and the generations after that can maintain that that standard of living I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s possible  as loving nurturing funny  we laugh a lot and  caring honest  things that I mean my best I have will actually my best friend is it&#39;s two people it&#39;s two sisters that I grew up with and we for some years took care of their mother was Alzheimer&#39;s before my parents got sick so I would had a very close have a very close relationship with them still do and so I&#39;m considered the fourth sister so I would say that those are my best friends and and  we love each other very much is a good relationship  no  no  yes  most mostly mine early depression it was more anxiety probably it&#39;s probably been five or six years I mean I&#39;ve had it off and on all my life but it was never diagnosed originally like as a teenager I think is when I first had started with anxiety but  other than that I let you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it&#39;s not under control but now it&#39;s under control so I have a great huh  no I think it was what they call fleece free floating anxiety more of a organic reason for it in other words that there was a chemical imbalance  in my brain  I&#39;ve been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great good family gatherings a little stressed because we&#39;re making a big decision right now to help my parents out my dad is really sick and we&#39;ve offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of  some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we&#39;re in the throes of that and so that&#39;s a big big change but I&#39;m looking forward to it because I really don&#39;t want my parents to be alone as they get their in their 80s  so as I get closer to death I want to have my family there with them  not easy usually all my life I think I&#39;ve always I mean I&#39;ve always had at least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom basically  other than that I mean no not sleep well I mean other than that I sleep well but sometimes if I wake up like really early in the morning then I can&#39;t go back to sleep I&#39;ll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep because I want my schedule is when if the kids are have to be at the school early and there&#39;s a lot of factors  sometimes it does  probably basically the same I think I might complain the bit like oh I&#39;m tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but I think overall I&#39;m probably the same  my kids know I&#39;ll be there I&#39;ll tell my get though I&#39;m really tired and they&#39;ll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful and letting my the. I will try to cook dinner or something like that so that you know  then they put you in a little bit more  not really not not no  not really. I think significant  actually yes I do I do feel like therapy is useful  well we had a situation with my daughter  she also suffers from anxiety and we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently our we&#39;re about to finish a group with her it was a 6 months  group for DVT it&#39;s called and it&#39;s like a the first time that is the first time they&#39;re documenting using it with teenagers and it&#39;s been really good it&#39;s been very helpful it&#39;s just all about how to live in the moment and how do you know the actual physical and mental strategies to keep you or keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or we know  in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so that&#39;s the focus of the therapy and it&#39;s been really good my husband and I both have been going with our daughter and it&#39;s been really really informational and really helpful I think  oh my God I was she was in a bad way she was being all suffering a lot and we knew it and we acted on it that&#39;s all  like  really joyful and happy I would say probably  probably would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the ethic in Cana  so you know where the wedding of Cana took place that was really moving and beautiful and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day we flew to Israel on so it was right at the same time it was beautiful  find meaningful and other than that I would say you know like other joyful occasions have been you don&#39;t like Christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad&#39;s birthday turned 83 on Christmas Eve you know that kind of think so  that&#39;s an interesting question I would say  once I get like things done that I need to do like if I&#39;m have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or  answer one once I get them done I feel like I could sense of accomplishment  you know much like I mean I worked for many years in it as an administrative manager at UCLA and  you don&#39;t want to get a project done or you get your whatever month-end stuff done or there&#39;s a lot of different things that have to meet deadlines or so that feeling of like yeah I got it done you know so I think that would be a no for me the most  most recent way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished  dream job  I think I&#39;ve already lived it I&#39;m also a birth Doula and yeah and so I&#39;ve attended a lot of Earth and now I really only do it for family and friends and it&#39;s the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth of bringing a new life into this world so I would say that&#39;s probably was my was a dream job and I didn&#39;t know what I trained much after you know I did my managerial stuff and  with all it is and was awesome so I don&#39;t work at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that I work at is now closed but  but like I said it for family and friends  I attended a friend of mine&#39;s Birth by accident she up she happen to have the same old BS I did with all my children and I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were freaking out close friends and you know her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there she wanted me to say she didn&#39;t want me to leave I hadn&#39;t planned on it so that was the first birthday I attended outside of it you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that it was really interesting and interested in possibly setting nurse-midwifery  but then I discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more Hands-On one-on-one contact with the patient which is what I like  so I tried to do that at the hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago cuz my son is 15 and he was a year Old Mill 16 years ago so  yeah and I&#39;ve been  well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman is in labor but and you know also like for me I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be there dual that I cannot guarantee 100% I&#39;m not doing it for business and that way and because of that I don&#39;t have like backup doulas that in case I&#39;m sick or I&#39;m not available somebody else could fill in for me so but so far it&#39;s been that all the women that have asked me I&#39;ve been able to be there for some reason still there  the the only one that I missed was one A friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby I was with her for her first but her labor went so fast you didn&#39;t call me in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of Labor she would even if it called me I would have been there in time so I went really fast but other than that you know  yeah I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been able to attend all the verse of people that have asked me to do  all of life or in your job  probably might my own births I mean my the birth of my own children  like there&#39;s an extreme  sense of Joy excitement relief because of course you&#39;re out of the pain and then like it&#39;s just it&#39;s just a matter of you know going forward from there but it&#39;s it&#39;s like something you can explain it&#39;s just it&#39;s awesome after you give birth so  and I&#39;ve experienced both ways I&#39;ve done both natural and I at my last job was a spy a C-section so I&#39;ve had both both experiences  all right with my Fairchild had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when I was in labor it wasn&#39;t funny and she  she was not there when the doctor I mean it was my third child was  born very quickly after he broke the water and wolf my husband was there but she was not in there with the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that and my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great cuz I didn&#39;t have to go through any of the labor but I&#39;m sure they weren&#39;t happy that you fill out a lot of paperwork after that  so  now what I get myself for 10 or 20 years ago  10 or 20 years ago is probably more not as some relaxed not as  like I feeling out my age that  I don&#39;t have the same concerns that I did then it&#39;s I don&#39;t worry about I don&#39;t worry at all about what people think about me I don&#39;t worry at all about what you know you know like why I noticed my daughters on Mom you can&#39;t wear that because people are going to say this I said I don&#39;t care you know but they do because it&#39;s still in their frame of mind that owe mom you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever so that would probably be at the wisdom that you you achieve with AIDs that you do see how life there&#39;s so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things  most proud of  probably my family like my husband and my my children I mean the fact that we&#39;ve stayed married that we weren&#39;t intact family that my kids see every day how their friends suffer who who come from divorced families or single parents and they they actually Express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so I would say that&#39;s probably it  probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgemental through the years I&#39;ve had a lot of experience with  people with problems lot of friends with problems people I know from church and it&#39;s just taught me that everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m better than someone else if you think you&#39;re better than someone else and that&#39;s usually to me a sign that you don&#39;t know yourself well enough  okay  okay  goodbye  real quick

like idle here and there exaggerations  nah nah never  the hardest  I guess I don&#39;t even know what the hardest decision was but I get face with hard decisions and those would be like I got so many friends sometimes I can&#39;t really hang out with everybody in one weekend cuz I got to make this is like if I go over this sector the town I&#39;m going to hang out with XYZ niggars I go over here XYZ evening so it&#39;s like you know those are hard decisions cuz I never like to let anybody down so that stuff like that deciding between friends to hang out with  house  it&#39;s cool I live in my mom  I come home like every 3 to 4 days  who  what can you repeat the question  my auntie  she&#39;s just really nice and she&#39;s like a little sweet little blind old lady who cooks really good and it&#39;s tight I don&#39;t know  something I could erase for my memory I want to want to erase anything from my memory  cuz that&#39;ll be like because like the experiences you go through make you who you are who you are I think we&#39;ve people like that want to erase things or block things out like that doesn&#39;t exist I mean there should that&#39;s been hard but I would never say I would not want that to happen cuz you know you must have got to learn from the experience you know I mean to be the better you all I see is like a it&#39;s like a test you know that bad experience was just testing you got over come and be stronger and not just like curl up and be like oh my God life hard that shitt I don&#39;t believe in that I have compassion for people who do get a who do want to do stuff like that but I still like I don&#39;t see the logic in it  I mean I stay up pretty late and do all sorts of a regular stash it but when I am home it&#39;s really easy I can just go to sleep you

396 okay thank you  thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people and it stays  are you okay with  yes  okay  Virginia  I wanted to live somewhere different than Virginia with a little bit more of diversity  once a year maybe  add song it&#39;s a lot slower and there&#39;s a lot left to do there  I wanted to live somewhere different and a nicer warmer climate and somewhere where there&#39;s a lot more to do and I was a lot more going on  for me it was really easy cuz I wanted some it was very different and I wanted something different  I like I like all the things to do like the Museum&#39;s I like the beaches in the mountains and all the hiking and all the free things to do  people don&#39;t appreciate what they have here that just come here and want to take something but they don&#39;t want to give anything back in bad drivers  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  not as much as I&#39;d like to I travel whenever I can but usually can&#39;t afford to you that much  well I like taking I like taking pictures a lot and I just like exploring new places my wife and I like to see you  wildlife and Hiking monuments and to seeing different areas  well we  we&#39;ve got we went to Central California we&#39;d like to be able to go more internationally places but that takes a while to afford so we&#39;ve gone more locally so we went to we went to Hearst Castle in the C the C the elephant seals and things like that  I guess  I guess our Palm Springs trip for our anniversary we did the who did the tram in the nice hotel on the jacuzzi and romantic dinner and it was a good time overall  guess somewhere in between  English and film  well I am  was told I needed to go to college in I haven&#39;t quite decided what to do yet so I just pick something I like to do for the time being  well wish I had not been pressured so I had more time to figure out what I wanted to I might have done something different like Physical Therapy but  are you still working or not  I know I&#39;ve been teaching gymnastics which is something I used to do before  what made you decide to do that  I needed to not starve and it did it it didn&#39;t end up being as bad as I thought it would be so I went for it and ended up being kind of fun  dream job is to have money and not have to work for it  okay  how are you at controlling your temper  overall pretty gif  I don&#39;t remember what about but it probably would have been few weeks ago with my wife  all anyone that I&#39;ve ever actually gotten upset and yelled always wish I wouldn&#39;t do that but sometimes when someone is not listening it drives me crazy  now if I just saying something over and over and they&#39;re just clearly not listening it makes me really upset  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to me  I don&#39;t know I I spent a lot of time on them but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know what the hardest one is cuz it if I decide to go with something and you know it&#39;s usually for a good reason  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  well I guess I feel guilty about moving to California in that I left my family and Virginia I mean I know I shouldn&#39;t but they always seem to miss me and even though they don&#39;t like living there you know I&#39;m the one that moved away so it&#39;s like I abandoned them  well I mean I don&#39;t miss Virginia but I do miss them so I guess a little hard  I have a good relationship with my  with my wife with my in-laws with my mom dad and sister there&#39;s no problems everyone gets along well  very close  mean anything anything where someone gets hurt either physically or otherwise  depends on how much exercise I have get a lot of exercise is pretty easy if I don&#39;t it&#39;s not  kind of like right now just a little bit  swelling out of it but not really too different otherwise  how do you been feeling lately  I&#39;m just kind of run-down cuz my um my mother-in-law&#39;s is dying and we just spent like 3 days in the hospital and we&#39;re going to go back after this so not a lot of time to sleep  just some  just us just slower and more tired and a little more out of it that&#39;s all  have you ever been tigers  no  now  usually just when I&#39;m having having a fun day either on my own or with my wife that&#39;s it&#39;s pretty easy for me just getting outside and and and Hiking or exercising not hard for me  I&#39;m not sure maybe I&#39;m maybe like eccentric but in a good way hopefully  is there anything you regret  no  2  be careful with your to be careful with your job to make sure you could keep from being injured and two  I don&#39;t know just just your normal your normal kind of older kind of wisdom  can you tell me about that  not much just a really everyone realizes things when they get older they wish they had when they were younger  what are some things you wish you can change about yourself  I wish I could get rid of my back injury so I could get back into shape like I used to be at some the biggest thing right now  not much to say just hurt my back at work and I just like to get past it cuz it&#39;s you know holding me back from doing a lot of things that&#39;s all  smile like you used to do gymnastics and trampoline and used to be a lot more active or work out more and now I can only work out a little bit cuz it hurts too much  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  probably like during that during the day going going on a hike or to a park with my wife and enjoying taking pictures and Wildlife and exercising and then at night you know if we watch a movie or go dancing or just something like that  is proud of them proud of moving here and then I came here without knowing anyone and I was at a point where I could have stayed in Virginia and gotten comfortable and you know ended up doing something I regretted but I came out and I&#39;ve always thought that was a good decision  my parents my grandparents my wife most people in my life have been  I think I got everything I need

482 okay yes  I&#39;m doing fine  I was born in Texas and I moved to California when I was three and grew up here in California  I was yes  I&#39;ve never been back there  I don&#39;t have any relatives there don&#39;t have a reason to go back there  well my at my family&#39;s here  that&#39;s one the weather is great the beaches and mountains are here  all those things are very good  the traffic was probably most people say it&#39;s expensive to live here who&#39;s probably talk to you  recently I&#39;ve traveled  well you get to see new places in a new people you get to learn more about other cultures and different ways people think  how at the end of March and went to Ecuador for a week  I spent most of most of one day with with an Ecuadorian who only speaks Spanish and I speak very little Spanish so we got it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him felt like a little kid trying to narrow saying yo what&#39;s this what&#39;s this is very humbling  you&#39;re just just saying that  and when you don&#39;t we&#39;re not able to communicate that that can be very difficult  I&#39;m probably more of a shy person  genetics I don&#39;t know why  I&#39;m an electrician so I studied electrical construction have also saved a computer networking  it was  I guess just kind of circumstances I needed the work I was doing wasn&#39;t providing for the family and I knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work until so I pursued that because of the financial gain  it&#39;s giving me a lot of opportunity  but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s why I do what I want to do for the rest of my life  well I&#39;m actually pursuing becoming a missionary my wife and I are looking at moving down that Corridor in the fall for 4 years and last year we we trained in North Carolina for one year and that was like Theology and Bible training  basically God put a desire in my heart to get Beyond could be on myself and and do something for other people to to go in and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them  all my immediate family  I have my Mary have been married for 10 years this June and we have four daughters and then but I have one older brother  how no sisters  to what what do you want to know about my family  I&#39;m really close with my wife and my daughters are with my brother I&#39;m not not real close partly because he&#39;s at he&#39;s mentally handicapped he has the mental capacity of a 7 year old even though he&#39;s he&#39;s five years older than me so just kind of because of that Dynamic it&#39;s hard to have a close relationship with him by I&#39;m pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents  I tell you my I use fashion high school he was a real real positive influence and me  just he has a  he has a drive in his heel for for pursuing the truth  and just a  studying the Bible in and because of his influence that kind of put me on a path to wanting to study the Bible  I think I&#39;ve gotten better at it there have been times when y&#39;all get angry and  yo it can just kind of really rule over me just the frustration and I&#39;m the type of person that takes me usually it takes some time for me to get angry and then some time to to calm down again but I&#39;ve I&#39;ve learned over time that really getting angry and keeping that anger and doesn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t attack the other person or the thing that I&#39;m angry at it just kind of attacks me it&#39;s a really it&#39;s not a it&#39;s not good behavior to to keep so wet when things anger me I tried to like talk to the person saying it was at this situation is making me upset try to can&#39;t talk through it and in resolving come to a resolution even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root of the problem  well a couple weeks ago or made it as me being a month ago my wife and I were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left it we&#39;re just driving down to Orange County area for this trip and my wife wanted what she had said expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things we packed and but hadn&#39;t really and in my eyes had Express that clearly but her eyes she had and so when I was trying to meet those expectations she knew I didn&#39;t meet him according to to what she wanted and then she became angry and so from my perspective I was doing what she wanted and kind of getting attacked for it so so that I I started yelling at her and  and we know we have that conflict but then  yeah we&#39;re within an hour so we kind of talked through and we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was  are you asking the moment of during the conflict  very ill just very angry you know you can feel it in your body part part of the anger is play the secondary response but my initial response was that on if it was feeling attacked and that came out as anger so I would think yes or no should I felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger  I guess it was  deciding to go  hum to go toward training last year I felt the guy to put on my heart that this was something I supposed to pursue my wife didn&#39;t feel that way and I  I just feel very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time I knew that if if my wife wasn&#39;t supportive of it that it would kind of fall apart so I kind of relinquished it and I said her you know I&#39;m not going to make you go  your life if you want to go then then we&#39;ll go but if not then we&#39;ll we&#39;ll do something else we&#39;ll we&#39;ll look at at doing something else and not going so that that was difficult for me cuz you again that I kind of felt like a loss cuz I felt deeply that that&#39;s what I was supposed to do but then after I kind of gave that up then then she came to a point where she said no I have a piece about not doing this and I went ahead and pursuit at so so just kind of giving it up what was it was difficult for me  tell you about something bad or something that I can erase my memory  I miss you  not sure  I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t really think of anything very traumatic that I would want to erase I think you&#39;re good things and positive and good things and bad things they all kind of  shape who we are and  so I I can&#39;t think of anything that would want to erase  usually usually it&#39;s not too bad  are you referring to on the the questionnaire when I said that I had some trouble sleeping  that the job a works at the  kind of the scheduling a shifted so I so lately I&#39;ve been working some night time shifts or graveyard shifts so coming home in the morning you know when it&#39;s light and it&#39;s been hard for me to sleep but it was it was mostly cuz I was staying up so late because of work  pretty easy  what I do when I don&#39;t sleep that I do get cranky  I&#39;ve been feeling good lately  no not really  no  no  her--no  can&#39;t think of anything that was  cut out of the ordinary but  yesterday we my wife and I took two or three younger girls we took him to the park the oldest one stay with her grandma but we we took him to the park and they played and  yeah so that those are always happy times we take the kids to the park  I think you say I&#39;m a family man sad  I&#39;m a Dependable that he can he can count on me usually might my friend I end up doing different work around the house for him cuz I&#39;m kind of a handyman so  so that way I think you say I&#39;m kind of Dependable or someone you go to for advice  I guess I would  I guess I would like to be able to start conversations with people easier  sometimes I have trouble just talking to people especially if they&#39;re in a group if people are 101 then it&#39;s it&#39;s usually easier for me to talk to them but kind of talking to people in a group how I wish I was a little better at that  now if it&#39;s  okay what was it say right before that was that  if if I&#39;m giving a speech or something to a large group I don&#39;t really have a problem with that but if it&#39;s more interaction type thing that&#39;s kind of call advisor we&#39;re going to myself turn 20 years ago I probably would have been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life  that&#39;s about it  think I&#39;m that would have been the biggest difference in my life I think  what if I have 4 Kids and  I hope I&#39;m raising him right I hope that  that alarm for the mistakes that I&#39;ve made I can kind of guide them through their their journey in life and I hope that they end up a little  better for it then than me  yeah I just hope hope kind of threw them that I can  heal  believe something worthwhile  you&#39;re welcome  goodbye  Torrid  okay

488 okay yes  fine  San Fernando Valley  I&#39;ll I really like the culture of going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around  it&#39;s spread out a lot and it&#39;s a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and that have a good public transportation system  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot and that really like to go camping but I don&#39;t really travel  I think I might have been around 6 months ago I went on a trip with a geology class  yeah it was fun  I think it&#39;s tough to say  well I think the first time I went camping was probably really memorable I went to Death Valley and I got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night  philosophy  yes  I don&#39;t know I think it just sort of happened I wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then I kind of grew disillusioned like that and I liked all the different ways are all different things I could do with philosophy  I don&#39;t know but I really like children and I really like  cutting their behavior so I think something along those lines might yet  I think I&#39;m generally pretty outgoing I can&#39;t be shy on my family but when I&#39;m around friends and stuff I I think I&#39;m pretty friendly  I&#39;m a lot of times I watch TV or read  I think I&#39;m pretty good I don&#39;t really get mad I try to think about other things if I start getting mad or I just started trying to focus on my breathing  the last time I argue with someone else probably with my boyfriend and I&#39;m having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was  I think it was I wasn&#39;t feeling very well and I was having trouble deciding whether I wanted to go to his Department&#39;s end-of-year party and he was getting frustrated which I thought was very inconsiderate cuz I wasn&#39;t feeling well to begin with  well I felt like he wasn&#39;t really taking my feelings into consideration and I really hate when he gets stressed out or I gets angry easily because I just see necessary and it stresses me out  I think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother when my oldest little brother does something wrong I tend to be harsh with him we&#39;re not as close as my sister and I or my youngest brother and I and so he tends to be hostile back and I think that if I were little bit more gentle might be easier to communicate with him  when I was 19 I came home  travel party I think around 4 a.m. on a Sunday morning and my. Get really mad at me and yelled at me and said a lot of that very nice things and then he didn&#39;t speak to me for about a year  I want my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that I don&#39;t live at home I used to be really frustrated with her all the time cuz she has a really quick temper but I think now that I&#39;ve got a little bit more just so I can see that she does the best she could  and I love my siblings I again my little sister and I get along really well she&#39;s 4 years younger than me and when  when she was around 12 and I was around sixteen was really difficult cuz she a really harsh time for her and she was always Moody and I wasn&#39;t in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don&#39;t anymore and that&#39;s really great and  we get along okay with my my older little brother who&#39;s 15 and I think I&#39;m going along pretty well with my youngest brother who&#39;s 12  one of the first not the first part one of my first Varsity professors and I really loved her classes and it was really good I&#39;ll being in class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that  I think it&#39;s pretty easy I mean sometimes I have trouble going to sleep but I thought that it&#39;s I think it&#39;s usually harder for me to wake up in the morning  well I&#39;m really tired I can get grumpy but I think usually I&#39;m just  groggy  good I&#39;m a little anxious about  about getting a job and I&#39;m going to be taking for my school about it&#39;s only one class so a lot of free time  well I mean it&#39;s not the end of the world if I don&#39;t get a job but I know that I will eventually so mostly I think I just try not to think about it too much and I tried not to be pessimistic  no  no  well I think last time I felt really happy I  went to a party with my boyfriend Matt and does apartment party and I wasn&#39;t you know I knew a couple people they are so I felt comfortable but I love that also able to meet new people there a couple kids there a special on the pool and a couple of drinks and ate some food and it was fun  I&#39;m sure probably say that I&#39;m smart  pretty intellectual I love to read and to watch  really like series films and TV as you&#39;re probably all state on fun cuz we like to go out and have fun a lot  well I can be really just organized and the packets me in trouble sometimes it will so that&#39;s a major loan then and procrastinating  tell me about a time when someone  I got into a little bit of trouble of few months back and have to go to court and was given 60 some hours of community service and of course I procrastinate and I&#39;m doing that so I have to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn&#39;t seem as she yelled at me but it didn&#39;t seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just a little less talk speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so I understand cuz that&#39;s his job but it was  not great for me cuz I wasn&#39;t I was really anxious in that situation  well I would have been 12 + 2  I think  I think I would have told myself at 12 not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents cuz I think I was a little selfish and self-involved II  I can&#39;t really think of anything I regret how I treated my mother when I was a kid but everyone does that and I do regret a couple of semesters ago I didn&#39;t do so well in school and I got a few W switch I now have to work to get off on my transcripts  I think so I am I think I wasn&#39;t focusing in school at that time and I didn&#39;t see any counselors at school or anything so I definitely couldn&#39;t find that  I think I probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping on Saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding and Jackson picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast Sunday and just like window shopping  maybe watching a little bit of TV  well-met youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up I&#39;m 10 years older than him so and being the only size of us took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but I&#39;m really proud of how she turned out and  and how close we are

440 when it&#39;s always female yes  I&#39;m okay thank you  I was born in East Los Angeles  yes  the freedom to explore outdoors with different weather temp out with weather temperature and climate to go skiing or to the beach may be in the same day  I think probably the overcrowding and the smog  I&#39;m sure you can tell them  not not frequently but I have  meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures  sure I&#39;m the last trip I&#39;ve taken outside of here was too heavily and that was my second time being there and  I enjoyed it more this time because  I knew what I wanted to say when I came back and and I was better prepared for  Italians and their culturally I felt I wasn&#39;t isn&#39;t you know I was just better prepared I thought for that trip  that would be  being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the mist of  acres and acres and Acres of grapes with just  magnificent  human development  I actually didn&#39;t decide it first to do that I started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and I went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant  and through the process I learned that I had to do a long internship without pay and at the time and I miss I had a family so I had to make a career choice quickly and so the college offered  human development major and I just went right in and used my use my units that I had already acquired towards that particular major in and I&#39;m happy with it  I&#39;m currently no I stay at home I have a little one is not so little I&#39;m preparing to go back to work in the meantime I design jewelry  well I have three children I have almost four-year-old and then I have two older children 17 and 23  no  that your children that the love from them and for them is unconditional  all the stages that they go through their stages all the time for every age  and everybody in my household is all different because they&#39;re different ages so  I think I&#39;m probably more in tune with those different stages that&#39;s why it makes me crazy and I think that my parents the time that my parents were parents he was just kind of like you know is she fed is she dressed as a house I mean a roof over her head and we&#39;re doing greatest parents and we love her and so it wasn&#39;t there wasn&#39;t too much I felt that that parents thought about in terms of n terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there&#39;s books for every age every year month you know and  so I think it difference differs in that way tremendously  fairy clothes  outgoing  I don&#39;t I don&#39;t feel uninhibited I feel you know confident to talk to people I probably talk  more than I need to  I bead I do I design jewelry that&#39;s what I do to relax  I&#39;m pretty good II  well I think I  trying not to not to feel or let others know what my emotions are when I&#39;m upset which is not good because if I don&#39;t do anything with them then I know that some point it&#39;s going to come out and  yeah that that&#39;s something I have to work on  like exercising or something  hey with my husband and it was about  he asked me whether I thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him  I really tired of talking about that same topic  well it came it spawned from a client of my husband&#39;s who&#39;s a female and she shared with him that she&#39;d been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if I ever thought about it and what made me  I think about cheating and he knows that I&#39;ve been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did I think about cheating and  I we&#39;ve had this conversation a lot of times and I mean not just that but  I don&#39;t know just about cheating in general and so I just said what I normally said normally is that I haven&#39;t cheated in that I did think about that when we were first together and I thought it was just a mere thought and  and then his response was I know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just came out  I guess irritated me I was really bothered by that and I just started liking you know we&#39;re having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation are you the one that&#39;s cheating and so that&#39;s how that that went into  that argument I mean he wasn&#39;t yelling at me and was part conversation and part texting  not talking  at all  pretty much any situation that involves my children and if I&#39;ve yelled because I really don&#39;t like if I came to the point where I&#39;ve had more of yelled it bothers me because  I was yelled at a lot and I just  feel bad about that and I try really hard to not  handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset I might get and results and yelling  tell me about the hardest  that would probably be whether to keep  a pregnancy or not  yeah I am  I was just talking about yesterday actually and  I&#39;ll always pregnant and I had wanted I wasn&#39;t married yet and I had wanted to be married and but I just didn&#39;t think that it was the right time for me  and I had pretty much made up my mind that I was not going to keep that pregnancy  but I made the decision by myself and when my partner found discovered that I was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me  and so that decision was quite hard because I felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and  and  earpiece  Erica  that was probably the hardest decision actually not know I wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make I&#39;m sorry the hardest decision that I had to make  in my life was whether or not  the hospital should I unplug the life life support machine for my father or not  that was our decision  because I knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself  was beyond who he was and I just couldn&#39;t see him  like that anymore and he would be a vegetable I was told  so I agreed  to Amritsar.  Not  hardly ever  too many things running in my mind  and pretty much mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends even though I  know that they&#39;re going to I mean I&#39;m constantly worried about how they are when they come home and so I really can&#39;t fall asleep on the weekends most time but  sometimes it&#39;s just been so many days of not getting good night sleep I&#39;m just too exhausted I pass out  but it&#39;s hard  very stressed  my son is is  has been in dealing with some legal issues and currently is incarcerated and  it&#39;s been really hard  yes I&#39;ve been probably very short Moody irritable  well I often think about a lot of things that aren&#39;t even happy my mind just goes from when point A to point B and I don&#39;t even know how I got there now  it&#39;s interesting  yeah  yes  about 3 years ago  my  OBG suggested I I see a psychiatrist  yes  well I&#39;ve in the process of changing therapist so it&#39;s been about because the program that I was in Lost funding and I lost my therapist. The therapist that I was working with and so it&#39;s been  about two months maybe three now and but I did notice when I was in therapy. It was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist I really helped me cope  when I picked up my son from  when he was released  from  Gel  I go get her probably you know should we use the term Hustler but meaning that I&#39;ll I&#39;m not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what I need to do to support my family I mean you know legally of course outgoing  maybe sometimes a little too for to outgoing for her  and compassionate  sensitive  loyal  all the things that remind me of my mother  well yelling the yelling part was when  just the little things that used to drive me so crazy I can see myself  doing them and it bothers me a lot  regarding what  not too much really I don&#39;t know  to go to college right after high school or not right  and and  that I didn&#39;t really need to be in a relationship to be happy  that are that you don&#39;t have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and  live life  what did I do  I visit my son yesterday and that was really good  I was happy that he was safe  my children  and  my accomplishments in  school and work  bye  purpavis tilted back and let came off okay maybe stopping it did not get got everything you needed
335 start up a virtual human who will chat with you for a bit and then when she&#39;s done she&#39;ll let you know and I will put the  okay sounds good  yes  I&#39;m okay  I&#39;m from here originally Los Angeles  I like the weather  and my family&#39;s here which is why I&#39;m here I&#39;ve moved away for awhile I like that there&#39;s a lot of even though everyone says there&#39;s no culture in La there is a lot of culture there&#39;s theater and film and lots of museums and things like that all different kinds of people I like the diversity  well I don&#39;t like that I had to move back into my will so starting a new career starting over in my career it said that&#39;s not really something I move back cuz my dad was sick  so  thank you thank you  I&#39;m here but it also means I live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous  acting theater  yeah yeah I am  I&#39;m an actor right now I&#39;m doing a a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and that sort of thing  well my parents are both artsy people and I grew up around it and for a long time I was singing and then I was went to study musical theater and somewhere along the line they realize that acting was more my bag than singing I suppose but I still do both  now I don&#39;t  I don&#39;t usually have trouble talking to people I&#39;m pretty friendly I can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within 5 minutes of meeting me how much I feel like is Mark of an extrovert  I took a bath or read a book go out with my friends  go to the theater  sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or and he&#39;s not going for a walk  yoga  things that makes me mad  Injustice I can be very righteously indignant I suppose  people who don&#39;t see those things that people who have like entitlement I think entitlement incentive privilege that can make me mad yeah  it depends I usually a lot of times it&#39;s I argue my case I guess all right I call my best friend usually and complain talk to her about it  pretty good pretty good I don&#39;t have too much of a temper  like a real argument or like a debate  if it was a real argument probably would be my ex-boyfriend and we just argue about why we broke up stupid things like that  I think I was kind of  over it by then but it wasn&#39;t times  that&#39;s why I felt really happy  was  really happy  probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night had a good time  my best friend would describe me as an open book she often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything she would describe me as  compassionate and having a strong sense of who I am  I think yeah she also said she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably that&#39;s something that she  make fun of me for because I do just like tell everyone everything and don&#39;t realize that I have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing I think that we have a very good relationship  yeah yeah it has it&#39;s not terrible trouble but but yeah it&#39;s got me in trouble for sure  I haven&#39;t  no but I think I had it  but I never went to a doctor cuz I had a I had a traumatic situation where somebody injured me and I when I looked up PTSD later I realized I felt like I had all of the symptoms of like going back in a situation like that I would get panicky and it was very I held onto it for a really really long time I think I think that I did have it but I just I don&#39;t know cuz I never I never saw anyone about it  sometimes yeah certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or it happened in a in an acting class so sometimes certain teachers if they criticize in a certain way I start to I start to panic even if they&#39;re totally right and I know they&#39;re right and like it&#39;s something that someone else could tell me and I&#39;d be fine with it sometimes it&#39;ll make me a little upset or panicky  well I mean my dad is sick so not great  but but considering not terrible  i&#39;ve been having bad dreams  apps like stress dreams I think having to do with my dad  I getting kidnapped and my teeth falling out things that if you look them up always say like there&#39;s something out of your control she&#39;s slick exactly what it is so  it&#39;s not the best but it&#39;s just dreams at least so  which way  easy very easy  I am tired and irritable goofy I get really goofy  yeah  I  and fairly non-judgmental of other people like I stay open-minded I can make most people laugh funny creative  I  that is some of the best ones I&#39;d say  I love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning and just getting out of the routine I like staying in hotels I like most things about traveling I even I even like flying I like all of it  well I just finished eighth or a couple months ago going up and down the east coast and then across the u.s. send performing for kids all over yeah and then we ended up here in LA  yeah yeah it was great as a good time  I think we  we went to  the hot springs the naturally occurring hot springs in Colorado and that was really nice I was a nice way to unwind  a lot of people I I would say my dad comes to mind certainly my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well  my best friend my best friend from high school I think I set a few of my best friends from high school and college that I kind of grown up with and become Who I Am with them  Small Things sure  I regret  the way that I dealt with  a friendship that was ending once I regret committing to certain people that have dated  but nothing huge I tend to go well I won&#39;t do that again but I don&#39;t spend a lot of time like being upset about things I&#39;ve done in the past  stand up for yourself  don&#39;t date felons  I think that I  I don&#39;t have any trouble standing up for things that I believe in but sometimes I have trouble standing up for myself I think I I really internalized the idea of like you know women being too needy or or I don&#39;t know those kinds of things and then and so as as an adolescent and growing up I felt like well you didn&#39;t you just shouldn&#39;t need anything or you&#39;re needy and it took me awhile to be able to like a voice what I want what I needed from other people and be okay with that and still something to work on  I&#39;m glad you think so  I could question  my friends and family  and  add my talents I would say  yeah yeah my ability to take situations and  take bad situations and continue and make the best of everything  all right  thank you  goodbye goodbye
625 regular and so the virtual human to ask you some questions and then  then Italy speech speech recognition to like I register what you say and then he&#39;s a series of  I know what to do back in the reason that the connection webcam is so that it can also take into account your facial expressions and your posture  what is war of the sea  is it a party at college thesis or anything  bring up the virtual human for a second and then shrink  I kind of wish that was really cool I am not doing so yet because I have just finished my second year so  so I don&#39;t know yet  what is the first California visit  dislike so right  okay  oh okay  I&#39;m going to start the recording okay  virtual check  and then  and then she said she said  you got it  okay  yes  okay  I&#39;m feeling pretty good  where are you from originally Montgomery Alabama  a lot of the sites of amusement parks lot of different places to go with my children  it&#39;s a big city a lot of stars live here so really it&#39;s a cool place  no not not anymore I used to but no not not lately in the last few years now  working on a movie set and getting to meet one of my favorite actors and also when I was in the military having being able to travel in Europe in a lot of places I thought I&#39;d never be able to see  my major was business administration minor was history  I Need You Now  actually right now I work part-time I don&#39;t have to actually have a steady job but you know I do some work with family members on Home Improvements but the primarily I&#39;m I&#39;m disabled so I don&#39;t get a chance to go to work very often at regular job  what&#39;s your dream job  oh probably work in some type of entertainment film music that&#39;s probably been my dream for years and years and I&#39;ve kind of dabbled in a little bit but never really made  foothold in that industry  I say outgoing  I just love people always have been a people person like to talk to people probably don&#39;t talk to people as much as I used to since it ain&#39;t got this missing tooth in my in my smile so it kind of takes away from me being as outgoing as I used to be  relationship with your family  it&#39;s pretty good I have three children have to Mom baby moms meaning you know I have two mothers of my kids but primarily my mom and I are pretty close but I have a very large family but we really don&#39;t interact that much  when I&#39;m feeling then I turn on the fish tank screensaver  play videogames right read I wish I could get enough get-up-and-go to write a screenplay I&#39;ve always been wanting to write and you never know what may happen with that but you know if I ever get some get up and go I&#39;ll write something but that&#39;s primarily what I do  pretty good I haven&#39;t done anything crazy or nothing in my life I guess but I do have a tendency to have a little bad temper  when was the law  this was recently argue with a friend over something very silly it was a sports question of something about sports and you know over the years my family are some people in my family have told me there&#39;s three things you really don&#39;t discuss with people that&#39;s politics Sports and religion so I try to stay away from those subjects  that&#39;s a great question I worked for a restaurant downtown who was which was owned by a very affluent lawyer in Los Angeles  the only reason I&#39;m mentioning his name because he&#39;s very prominent lawyer and not only in California but this what&#39;s this country and I lost a job they&#39;re getting into an argument with the manager of the restaurant but in actuality the owners is partner we&#39;re very very kind and they really liked me a lot and I should have never let that situation get to that  something you feel guilty about  I think  probably not spending more time with my children or actually spending time with my oldest daughter who lives in Maryland I feel guilty for not having been more of a success in my life  not having as much drive and determination as I should have that&#39;s probably my biggest no regret or what I feel is guilty about  tell me about  probably the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make was to join the military I had heard a lot of bad things about it at her good things about it but at that particular time of my life I had a you know a fork in the road and I had to choose where they go left to right and I chose to go left and joined the army and turned out it wasn&#39;t that bad of a decision  tell me about midnight or something that  haven&#39;t been a rat being arrested years and years ago  that&#39;s 20 years to be exact and it hasn&#39;t really affected me employment wise or anything like that but it&#39;s but it&#39;s it was on my record and it was something that should have been avoided but it happened and I just wish I could take that one back  yes  20 or 21 years old  well three reasons one I needed a change in my life to I had some personal things going on I felt it was time to like you know just taking advantage of her and try something different and I just wasn&#39;t really happy in my college experience so I thought I&#39;d try it  are you happy  yes  no but I can&#39;t close  I worked I was in the military when the Russians were still prevalent in Eastern Europe and we did some board of Duty between the East and West Germany and there are few incidences On the Border that could have gotten out of hand but never did  fairly easy  since since leaving the military in 1990 I found myself not being able to kind of interact with people as much as I used to you know things being that I was in the military you think that was a would be a little easier having live with people so close to you all the time but it actually made me a little bit more anxious and have little more anxiety around people  I came back to Los Angeles and decided to move to Georgia and spent four years in Georgia working and going to school a little bit and then came back to Los Angeles four years later after 1990  on the positive side I was physically fit when I got out very physically fit and enjoy being that way for several years until you know of some things happened in my life to where I kind of let myself go  but it changed me and made me more  orderly place things in perspective  emotionally pretty good physically tired  I didn&#39;t notice any change.  If anything I would say  just started wanting to have more and do more in my life that&#39;s about it  fairly easy I usually  go to sleep and sleep well some nights I toss and turn but it&#39;s rare and I would say it&#39;s rare but you know once I get to sleep I sleep fairly well  hello are visible in the mornings but since I live alone and a lot of people don&#39;t really feel that so  but that ain&#39;t none of my kids are around it&#39;s it&#39;s always more enjoyable to wake up cuz you know I can see their faces and and enjoy their company  yes  no I haven&#39;t actually been diagnosed with depression but I have bats of that every now and then  fairly recently I have my kids over for the weekend and I we had a good time enjoying each other&#39;s company so I was pretty happy man  I would probably say Pastor from my church her name is Pastor Beverly Allan she&#39;s been kind of a mentor for me for several years and she&#39;s a bit of a really big influence in my life and always kind of been there for me  tell your best friend  hopefully well they would say I was funny you know reliable steady and you know primarily upbeat person  I like to bowl so when we go bowling  play begin a bunch of guys will go out we&#39;ll go bowling just have a good evening and you know enjoying each other&#39;s company and trying to kick each other&#39;s butt on the Bowling  my children  they&#39;re my pride and joy then extension of me once I pass away the bill live on I live on through them so it&#39;s just an honor to know your have three healthy children that are happy very intelligent and maybe make a good Market Society  thank you  goodbye
421 doorbell back over here  alright great thank you  and please  are you okay with  yes that&#39;s fine  I&#39;m okay how are you  originally I&#39;m from San Francisco  originally I moved here in gosh 1995 then I went to Chicago then to San Francisco and then back to Los Angeles probably about 5 years ago  a lot of moving  never  there just isn&#39;t anything there for me anymore  the weather is better in LA but the people in San Francisco are nicer  my husband prefer my ex-husband prefers at here that&#39;s why we moved  okay  I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology and after that I went to law school  when I was in college I worked at a law firm and decided that I really wanted to be a lawyer it was really interesting  are you still working in that no now I&#39;m a stay-at-home mom  you find it easy to be a parent know I loved it but it is it is difficult you have to manage a life to make sure that they become a good and successful person  it&#39;s easy to kind of do the academics and stuff like that you know I&#39;m good at that the hardest thing I think is to guide them emotionally to help him through things that he&#39;s having a hard time with feeling like I don&#39;t have all the answers  I&#39;m just seeing them grow and and experience new things and learn about life in the world it&#39;s just it&#39;s really really cool  what are some ways that your  completely different completely different and I am not a perfect parent but I love my son I take care of him he&#39;s the first priority in my life and they weren&#39;t like that at all  well my parents are dead I didn&#39;t speak to my dad at all before he died I have a sister and a brother that actually I don&#39;t know where they are I don&#39;t speak to them either  do you consider yourself more shy  probably more shy because I consider myself more reserved  I like to listen to music  like what I have I listen to all sorts of music but my favorite when I&#39;m relaxing is that 80s music cheesy cheesy but true  it depends on who I&#39;m with if I&#39;m with my son I can control my temper if I&#39;m with my ex-husband or other adults yeah I don&#39;t  so so  yesterday and it was about my ex-husband dating the woman that he was cheating on when we were married  can you tell me about that  I found out he was cheating on me and I kicked him out and he told me yesterday that he&#39;s continuing to date her  yeah  really angry  and just really hurt  I wish that I had talked to my dad before he died I wish that I had settled our differences before he had died  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to  the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make was actually ending my marriage  because he was cheating on me  that would have to be  well I don&#39;t know I mean I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d want to erase anything from my memory because it makes me who I am today  but I can&#39;t really think of one event that I would want to erase  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I don&#39;t get a good night sleep it&#39;s not easy I wake up a lot in the night  I don&#39;t know I wish I knew if I knew I could change it I could try to do something about it but I I just don&#39;t I don&#39;t know  what are you like when you don&#39;t  grumpy irritable  grumpy irritable down  mixed with anger  can you tell me about  it&#39;s just because of everything that I&#39;m going through with my soon-to-be ex-husband  yeah there&#39;s  I just keep it inside  Meador Staffing else to really do except I mean it is what it is so  I have to  deal with it  no  yes  10 years ago after my son was born  9 years ago I felt like I couldn&#39;t cope with life  I was so down I couldn&#39;t I felt like I couldn&#39;t do anything  I need  no  I don&#39;t go to therapy I go to medication management but I don&#39;t do talk therapy  I have gone to a therapist and no they don&#39;t help  can you tell me if  well some just sit and stare at you and don&#39;t say anything you know if I wanted to talk to myself I would others give advice that I think is just  it just not not good and not on point  tell me about the last time you felt  it was probably this morning I was playing with my son  just really happy I wasn&#39;t thinking about  any of the other crap  in my life I could just forget it so I was feeling really really happy  I think they would describe me completely different from the way I would describe me but I think they would describe me as really sweet they have really sweet confident  outgoing because that&#39;s what I try to be two people so I think that&#39;s how they would describe me  I wish I wasn&#39;t sad I wish I was more confident  yeah there are a lot of things I think  it would be  to not  not give my life over to one particular person which is what I did with my husband  find your ideal weekend  I think I would spend my ideal weekend in a sunny place like Palm Springs with my son hanging around the pool having fun going out to dinner  one of my two of my friends to really good girlfriend so I think have been really positive influences in my life  can you tell me if  sure life is worse than mine and the but we can always commiserate together  is just really positive me she&#39;s always happy always up always look into the bright side so that has helped me a lot  my son  I went over to a friend&#39;s house and we had movie night we watch the grown up movie and had dinner and wine and the boys were in another room watching movies and playing video games and it was just a relaxed fun evening  thanks for

657 go ahead and start a camcorder recording and then your answer  okay  all right  I&#39;m not a therapist  I&#39;m pleased  are you okay with this yes I am  I&#39;m fine and yourself  where are you from originally  I&#39;m from Long Beach California  I love the weather I love  different things that La has to offer like food and different events that they always have especially during the summer months  what are some things you don&#39;t really  I hate the traffic  you travel a lot  yes I do  I just love to experience new things this world has so many things to offer and I don&#39;t want to be juice in clothes in a box when there&#39;s so much out there that I can see  I&#39;d like to hear about one of your trips  well  one of my trips that stands out the most was when I went to his Israel  that&#39;s pretty much where God was born and  I got to see where the cross was where they laid his body after he was crucified so it was really am I opening experience  which one of your most  probably  probably seeing where  they sing the location where they had the cross where Jesus was crucified was was probably the most memorable experience  I study criminal justice  what are you doing now  I do maintenance  then it is located in West LA  what&#39;s your dream  my dream job honestly is to become a police officer  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  when I was younger more shy but as I&#39;ve gotten older I&#39;ve grown out of that so now I consider myself more outgoing  why  I think that has come along with age because of with age comes more responsibility so you have to learn how to talk to people have to learn how to talk to different types of people and along with that the shyness kind of goes away by by default  tell me about your relationship with your family  oh man I can I honestly cannot ask for a better relationship with my family at all I have great parents I have great siblings I have four sisters everything about about them is great  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling  I turn on the  to relax honestly will my favorite music artist Sade so what I like to do is turn off the TV if it&#39;s hot out turn the fan on and I&#39;ll listen to some Sade  how are you  very well actually I don&#39;t have a temper I&#39;ve never had a temper so it&#39;s I find it quite easy to control it whenever I find myself getting mad but since I don&#39;t have have a temper it&#39;s pretty easy to control it  prop probably a week ago  yeah I would say about a week ago and it was with one of my co-workers because they felt that I treated them differently than my other co-workers which will actually is not the case  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  sometimes I feel guilty when I come into work a few minutes late but I sign in as if I sign in on time for work  tell me about the hardest decision  the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make was deciding whether or not if I wanted to join the military  I change I would necessarily say I changed my mind but I was very curious about it but I wasn&#39;t sure but I made the decision to go even though it was scary  but that honestly was probably my hardest decision to make  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could have  okay what event was when I was I was very little and the church that I was going to have the time they had they had set up this event where a bus will come and pick up all the all the kids and take him to Chuck E cheese  what ended up happening was the bus never never like never showed up so we were sitting there for literally about an hour and a half closer to ours and the bus never showed up and everybody was heartbroken  I know that&#39;s not really anything major but I mean I wish I could take take that away  have you ever  yes I have  when I join the military I was 21  to be honest I wanted a change in my life I wanted something different I feel like the military  would be a really great stepping stone just in life. As well as  they they help me pretty much pay for school so that and plus I got I got to travel so and and you know like it&#39;s always a great opportunity to serve my country you know  are you happy you did that  I am very happy that I that I join the Navy yes  did you ever see combat I did not see any combat  honestly it was kind of a struggle it wasn&#39;t that easy at first  easy well I mean it wasn&#39;t difficult but it was a struggle  because it&#39;s two different Lifestyles you know the natrol the military and civilian lifestyles are two completely different lifestyle so it was a lot more freedom going back and trying to the most difficult part was trying to find a job because I had came out right when the economy crashed so that was the most difficult part of my transition  to do after the military  I went to school and I had a student job at the  it changed me because I feel like it&#39;s giving me more driving life to go after the things that I want I feel like I&#39;m slightly more and more discipline  honestly I feel like after I join the military I speak up for myself a lot more often  how have you been  lately I&#39;ve been feeling great I don&#39;t have any complaints  I&#39;m happy with my life so lately I&#39;ve been feeling very happy and then satisfied  that&#39;s good  have you noticed any changes  not necessarily in my thoughts but in my behavior I&#39;m finding that I&#39;m taking more of a initiative with work and  you know I&#39;m with my peers in my family  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  on a regular basis I find it pretty easy  when I don&#39;t sleep well I&#39;m not really different I just feel like I have a little less energy throughout the day but that&#39;s really the only difference I I&#39;m I&#39;m still the same person  no I have not  okay  have you been diagnosed  no I have not  when was the last  the last time I fell really happy was probably when I got my paycheck yesterday  someone has been a positive influence in my life probably my father he&#39;s always putting me in the in in the right direction now I&#39;m here he&#39;s always  give me some great advice just about things of things in life in general you know so I can always go to him  how do your best  my best friend would describe me as funny outgoing nice  sincere  yeah  something I&#39;ve done recently that I&#39;ve really enjoyed  there is a a volleyball tournament down in Long Beach it was the the world series of beach volleyball and I enjoyed going to go into that because it was all free they gave out free food it was on TV it was on NBC I got I got to see Kerri Walsh so that made me really happy  nice  what are you most proud of  what am I most proud of I&#39;m most proud to say that I was in the military and I served my country  thanks for sharing your thoughts  thank you thank you  and then you are free  the other desk

A lot better than when I was a child  I can&#39;t even remember it&#39;s it&#39;s been a very long time  I guess so  can you tell me about the  I don&#39;t know not really  ratings about it right now  well I was waiting for my appointment  recently my girlfriend&#39;s been very positive  we met through my sister-in-law  muscle close anymore  I know, right  oh they just I don&#39;t have anything in common with him so we don&#39;t talk  I don&#39;t know I really don&#39;t  impatient I listen and I try to be reliable  move to California from New York that&#39;s that&#39;s been a good experience  it was nice I was exciting  no  it&#39;s fairly difficult  just I wake up very easily and sometimes it takes a long time to get tired and fall asleep  not that I know of  just quiet try to stay to myself cuz I get irritable  no  no  all right just anxious trying to find a job so  not really know just pretty pretty normal  my children  I&#39;ve got four of them 3:10 and then to 11 year olds  that&#39;s that are just I don&#39;t know some of the things they do is just the other day it&#39;s a lot of fun watching them grow grow up  just the way they interact with each other sometimes it&#39;s our other people it&#39;s it&#39;s really amazing to see how fast they you don&#39;t develop  I don&#39;t know there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot to her tied for probably most memorable  no probably not  yeah it&#39;s pretty easy it&#39;s it it&#39;s a lot of fun  worrying about him you know you worry about him getting hurt  no that&#39;s how much  probably go to college get you know try to find a look at a better job you know  I feel happy all the time though I mean on and off so it&#39;s that&#39;s real hard to pinpoint
453 hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today yes  Los Angeles  convenience convenience  people the crowd  traffic  people that lack of respect  locally originally  meeting old people I love talking old people  I work a lot with my elders in my reservation and other reservations here in California and I spend a lot of time with her with the elders I talked with them and they helped me out of  Target are good stories  going in the mountains and seeing waterfalls then no one else is saying except for my people and I was the most beautiful thing I think I found  it depends on the situation if I&#39;m if somebody comes to me looking for me to help them I take control it if I need help with its I work at asking for help so it depends on the situation  I Garden  and I think  very good.  3 days ago it was about communication and the lack of communication on the other person&#39;s part and I needed them to communicate better so that way I could understand and they didn&#39;t communicate so we had an argument and I got to settle  I felt I&#39;m caught off guard because this is an individual that I spend pretty much almost every minute of my day with and to not be told what was going on in this person&#39;s head and then to have a situation arise and I was kept out I didn&#39;t like that  I got a pass  probably lack of time spent with my grandparents  just wanted on you regret that you didn&#39;t miss time with spend time with me  I want thing I truly wish I could remember I was I was a professional athlete and what time I have party till like 4 in the morning and then I had did my event at like 10 in the morning and I was my captain and I&#39;m very smile team  that&#39;s one thing I truly believe that  are the professional fighter soon  yeah I&#39;m not party. About other people besides myself  I studied massage therapy and Nursing degree  a lot of it&#39;s just been on job education  I&#39;m very  I&#39;ll get to my own injuries I just going through the therapy process and believing in people and seeing how it worked and I decided to do that I wanted to help people too  are you happy  oh yeah  yes  I want to paint that&#39;s all I want to do is just paint  I have two sons and it&#39;s time for me to the move on and they&#39;re older and they can take care of themselves now so many leaving the area where my sons are sweetheart  the reflection of you  play reflection of you a mind you so much about yourself Who You Are  consistency even when you&#39;re sick  I don&#39;t assume my kids are right around by listen to him first and then make my decisions after that and I try not to come from an emotional hiding place but I think logically and I put myself in their place before I do it we discuss we communicate happy in my family cuz that&#39;s the only way we get along with each other through communication  communicate  my family is severed pretty much so my family my relationship with my family on the reservation is very tight and the rest of the family were all fragmented scattered around the Southwest so it&#39;s not very tight at all  I have too many to count  start with my uncle my uncle was like my dad. Me to go away  he watched out for me he told me he taught me hard work at a very young age he also taught me to protect my family  Tommy honor. Me Love  it&#39;s a good man  how easy is it for you to get a good night  I don&#39;t lie ever had a good night sleep in years so I have to get broken sleep  are dreams the dreams you come through real  get up and go to the bathroom and go back to sleep  my years of fighting and just got up to me  reserved  reserved and I try to find things to distract my brain to think of different ways of doing things  I got rid of TV about 8 months ago so I got rid of that distraction so what I do now is ready to paint a garden or cleaning house washing dishes or get out the walk that&#39;s nothing to do a lot of walking out is  anxiety anxious  my anxieties  habits good I have techniques to bring myself down  nothing new  out of the normal  yes  3 years ago around 3  insomnia issues  it was about  2 years ago around there to look it over two years ago I was released from therapy  off the therapist Release Me  what I noticed is I still deal with pictures and emotions  what would I do is now if I really practice hard at taking care of myself and then getting to those places to things that  strike me give me anxious or excited or angry I learn how to work out of it and realize it&#39;s not real it&#39;s not real  that&#39;s just the emotion it&#39;s not real so these are the things like no manches and I tell myself and this is really helped me a lot from therapy because it taught me that those emotions and pictures truly aren&#39;t real  and that&#39;s the therapies helped a lot that mean it&#39;s just a change my world  if  around the same time as the PTSD  after years ago  in my dreams when I dream I do  last night  I just dreaming of fighting and then in preparing fighters to fight I wasn&#39;t nothing to I build up anxiety dreaming about preparing fighters to fight and then stepping in front of thousands of people and then I always end up fighting in my dreams so it&#39;s always what gets me scared in all my dreams is that I should have made the move and finish the fight and I didn&#39;t  and so builds anxiety and stressing me that I tend to act out in my sleep  I was real like I was there right like I smell taste feel everything their house there  on this morning driving here talking to my girlfriend  trustworthy  he loves me I love him he&#39;s more best friends  a 02 change  I can recall  okay  I got it  just not spending time with my grandparents and in  I think they today issues maybe you know a couple here there that I should have went to the store first or something like that but I mean it&#39;s nothing like that  quit thinking you know it all  my loyalty  my trustworthiness  the new art project yesterday  nice  where is Santa Barbara from the film some rocks and some old rock song Someone that made by loving just threw a dump old rocks out of the way and it went through the pile of rocks and I found the soul rock that was in the middle of it and then took a home and now I&#39;m doing art piece on it and for me it was like the thing was totally forgotten about was just considered a rock and now they&#39;re sure you&#39;ll be sitting in my grand kids table and let&#39;s just give me a call like that  what are you most proud of in your life  start starting something that I&#39;m so bad at  then I don&#39;t think there&#39;s no way I can be good at it and all sudden I get to be better at it so I don&#39;t even have to think about it just so good at it that way I could just touch it and feel it and then I think about it these are the things I&#39;m proud of like I like that I like that  accomplishment I guess you can say  her her left clavicle needs adjustment  her clavicle set tired makes it look like she&#39;s been in a car accident and she&#39;s like this sheet her left shoulder is up higher and it&#39;s question so you&#39;re off and it&#39;s drawing my attention to that so I don&#39;t know if you guys noticed that to the other part of it too is the hand motions that she does some of the hand motions are very aggressive in it and wakes it was very distracting in the beginning because she was like  fast moving like my therapist cuz we working with the PTSD issues he that he did everything slowly cuz I said off on quick trigger movements and so like with her hand movements like that. Like this talkin it was distracting in the beginning but besides that everything is just like it&#39;s pretty amazing computer but it&#39;s and you feel comfortable that is a good thing  yeah yeah
438 okay yes I&#39;m doing pretty good  I was born and raised right here in Los Angeles  the weather would be number one I also like the diverse cultures I like the fact that there&#39;s a lot of different things here you can do and it&#39;s a lot of opportunity here not just for myself but for my kids and I think it&#39;s really a great place to be when you&#39;re trying to establish a career go to school learn about different people  the traffic the cost-of-living sometimes I think it&#39;s too big and that thinks the transportation system as far as the Bus and Train is long overdue they need to revamp it or you know add more buses and things like that just make it easier for people to get around on public transportation  I travel when I can a little bit here and there I have not been overseas yet which is a goal of mine within the next couple of years so I&#39;ve just travel domestically I try to take at least one trip a year somewhere  I just like the fact of getting on the plane and going places I&#39;m going to take me somewhere I&#39;ve never been and learning about that place you know like so if I&#39;m going to DC I really look forward to it cuz it&#39;s the historic City you know things like that  my most recent trip would have been DC his last year I went to go visit a friend and I stayed about I think three to four days and they got to see the capital he showed me around showed me all the you know historic landmarks and sites the White House the Capitol Building I got to see a lot of other different government building and it was it was a good experience the irony was I had to fly on 9/11 and so that had me a little and easy but once I was in the plane up in the air I was okay and it was all good and once I was back home I was like yes but I I just the trip and I look forward to going back  attending my friend&#39;s wedding she had a destination wedding in Hawaii actually Maui that was actually 233 years ago 3 years ago and all I guess and I&#39;ve been trying to get back ever since and I want to take my kids and I just love it there and actually come look forward to two moving there one day  I have three sons 13 year old twins boys and my youngest is also a boy he&#39;s eight they all have birthdays in June the twins are June 9th and my baby is June 4th and so they just a few days apart but five years apart technically and they&#39;re just super super typical boys active all over plays hormones puberty is actually an interesting time because you know the two older boys going through puberty their teenage years still trying to figure some things out for himself you know doing that transition stage of 8 to 9 years old so he&#39;ll be 9 in June and then my oldest if you 14 so it&#39;s a challenging time for me as well  just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent everyday and seeing how just with love and nurturing and the right and you know when I can take proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and an Italian man is so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and see how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they are going through now that&#39;s so reminiscent of my teenage years and it&#39;s just it&#39;s very rewarding in and actually I look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they&#39;re older and often college cuz I really love children giving back  probably a couple of things but I was just say  for me being a single parent is the financial well I would say that along with some of the emotional with them having to Bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing you know the just the everyday things so what you have to deal with sometimes when you just tired you don&#39;t want to be bothered or you&#39;re trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that okay I got to cook or had to go pick my son up for I had to take him to baseball practice this one wants to go for hear this one is acting Moody and you know just those those types of challenges that&#39;s what was the financial and you know making sure you know you&#39;re able to put food on the table you&#39;re paying your rent and you know you keeping up with the day today and that&#39;s those two are probably the hardest things for me to deal with  well I just take it day by day. I just put one foot in front of the other and I&#39;m extremely spiritual so I just rely on God and pray a lot and meditate if I see a need a little help if you know I&#39;m not above asking for help sell sometimes if I have to reach out to people or you know see what other resources are out there to help me you don&#39;t try to do that and so for me right now my biggest challenge is just trying to go back to school to put myself in a better economic situation so I can continue to provide for them comfortably  I studied Communications actually I was a journalism public relations major with a minor in sociology and now I&#39;m studying business  I just thought that you know  there would be more opportunities for me with business as far as jobs and then I you don&#39;t have a desire to go to graduate school so I just figured in the long run it was a better it will put me in a better position give me more opportunities with the communication just a little limited and especially as you get older the fields of TV report and things like that are kind of become you know harder to obtain so I just thought it I would going to something more realistic and you know but I like both fields are really do I like communicating riding reading talking as you can tell and sell the sea  a couple probably but I would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer going to different destinations trying different foods out writing about different people cultures learning in living you know about those different people and culture living amongst the you know that the people there and being interacted with the children and stuff like that so I kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes it would be something along those lines and then the fall back will be the counselor and social worker something in that area if I could Encompass all three hopefully I can that I would like to do that  that&#39;s a hard question probably because I initially grew up very shy in the not so much shy as I am reserved now but not Concerta but just reserved in you know what I go somewhere I&#39;m checking everything everybody else out and then once I become comfortable or activates his situation and I&#39;m like okay you know I warm up to the to the situation of the people but I&#39;m also friendly I can be very friendly and outgoing you like to talk you know I seem like a chatterbox but I&#39;m not really so usually if I&#39;m in a big space with the whole lot of people I don&#39;t like to be the center of attention I can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but I overall I am open Friendly person  for me I could be something as simple as just unplugging everything all electronics and just sitting for a few moments meditating praying or reading a good spiritual scripture if I&#39;m able to I like to go for a good massage maybe get a facial  you know things that will I, like the physical part part of a like massages things that really release tension and if not then like I said just sitting at home reading and praying or I like the beach I love the beach so sometimes that driving go sit by the beach I&#39;ll also like to just maybe go and have lunch by myself at our get a mani pedi or maybe go window shopping you know things like that  pretty good sometimes I&#39;m just like I don&#39;t really have such an issue with the temper as I am I just a more impatient unfortunately a lot of times with people you know situations so I just can become really irritated or irritable quite agitated especially if it&#39;s that time of the month for me and just lose patience outside of that I&#39;m actually pretty good I try to be very you know conscious of where I&#39;m at and be very patient with people especially if I can see that the person is like if there&#39;s a new checkout person at the counter or cashier I do try to be I do try to be patient and understanding cuz I would want that you know if it were me I would want someone to explain that to me  you know what my kids sometimes you know it&#39;s just a works both ways to lymphocyte time of the month I&#39;m just I guess just leave me alone or I might have a short temper or short fuse so I am conscious of it I try to be aware of it and then try to monitor it but you know like anybody I&#39;m human and there are times where I have my days are moments when I catches like I go off and just lose it  well I haven&#39;t really had not presenting an argument but there&#39;s been an ongoing thing with American Express so I would say  because it was not a personal contact with a company it really was an argument but I do know that I had some issues with American Express had to call in a bottle and I think Saturday and I&#39;ll tell I wasn&#39;t getting the response I expected inside look at the whole contact the call was just back and forth very frustrating and I was upset and you know the rap was trying over talk me you did I was trying to talk her so you know I don&#39;t know if you would consider that an argument but I would definitely say that&#39;s the last time when you know I just like reached my boiling point to say the least and was really upset and that I was the closest you know to an argument and then had to call back this morning that would be really up to delete an argument but it was a tense exchange for a minute or two  probably the most recent contact and that would have been the one on Saturday with American Express actually was on Sunday yeah and I know the person trying to help me but you know when you&#39;re constantly being told different things and I&#39;ve had to call in about five or six times about the same situation and it not be resolved it just takes you there so  just are kept raising my boys said some things I shouldn&#39;t have. And just was more so allowed myself to lose control of the contact I like to really feel in control of the contact and so it just took me there my blood pressure was raised  excuse me and that was just a kind of a mess for a while feel like maybe 30 minutes or an hour after that just irritable and agitated and upset and as far as always try to you know go back and pull from those and you know do my own sense of feedback and see how I can handle things differently but that&#39;s when I definitely wish I could have kept my cool and been more level-headed and and not really raise my voice and you know been more polite  what have probably have had a couple but police demos is a situation years ago when I just had my sons and they probably by twin there probably about 2 and I was in a situation with their father again and became pregnant and it just was not a good time and he pretty much scheudle was not comfortable with me having another child at the time and I wasn&#39;t comfortable with having another child either but wanted to keep the baby but you put me under so much stress and you know kind of thing I want to say really push me into having terminating the pregnancy and that&#39;s always stays with me and I&#39;ve always missed that pregnancy that child I think about that that baby or what could have been I try not to hold any anger or resentment towards him or anybody  but it but I know deep down inside secretly if I had it to do all over again I would have just I would have kept the baby and move forward so that would have been probably the hardest especially emotionally like a deal with a lot and I have dealt with a lot you know being unemployed or you know a lot of financial problems but that to me was the heart  thank you  no  OK Google  I was laid off in December so I&#39;ve been constantly trying to do things to you know get back on my feet so that&#39;s been a little tough and I had to face a lot of challenges and dealing with that and issues with child support and trying to find another job and going back to school so I&#39;m at my range of emotions have just have been just that arranged at a very good friend of mine now who we both started off  you&#39;re on the same place about five years ago well she&#39;s been able to move forward and going with her lies and now she&#39;s graduating in next month from USC with her masters in social work so I&#39;m feeling a little envious of that and I have been for like the past year but more so recently although I&#39;m very very happy for her you know and she&#39;s a good person and she deserves it back of course you don&#39;t got it when she was me so that she was kind of been bothering me  well I&#39;m really good with them people I communicate well I like to talk really good with children that&#39;s why I would like to teach her be a counselor  although I haven&#39;t got really tapped into it I know I&#39;m a very creative person I know I write pretty good I could possibly be a creative writer but I know very creative soul is given the opportunity I know I could tap into that and really develop those skills something like with Maybe song writing fiction writing but probably like interior decorating anything artistic just anything cuz I love musical of Arts I love drama love plays  Lubbock fashion buff but I do love fashion and makeup and stuff like that so I think those words are are my strong points as well as just getting along with people I know it would make a great counselor people my friends come to me all the time I have a good ear for listening I&#39;m a great mediator and I know how to because I&#39;ve been through a lot and one of my friends call me the voice of reason the one that&#39;s actually graduate from SC but I know I&#39;m like light years ahead of a lot of people when it comes to Insight and wisdom and I don&#39;t know what to do if you don&#39;t have an older parents myself or how I grew up or I have had very traditional so I can parents who is still a lot of Great Value thin me or if it has anything to do with my astrological sign I&#39;m a Pisces but I&#39;m really good with people just so you know. You know like I said I have my moments but I know if it&#39;s if it&#39;s something  I could go into a developed I would do well  really some of the situations or wish I would have waited to maybe have gotten married before I had children pick a different partner  and I say that mean my son&#39;s father is great but a great father for my kids and I was too much as a partner for me we&#39;re not together we have been together in years but I&#39;m just saying over Ross had I yeah I think I would say if I could let me backtrack that say not finishing school when I should have in my phone right my dreams and goals and doing things that&#39;s like animals planning initially and I think that&#39;s that would I honestly be the one thing I could say I regret is not following my goals and I&#39;m finishing school on time and episode when I really want to do  stay focus and finish school and pick a career path and stay on that and stay motivated and don&#39;t let anything or anybody to tell you  I think I&#39;m pretty stable and consistent just with overall thing come how I faced adversity house I face things you know I&#39;m a pretty committed person I try to you know if I say I&#39;m going to do something to try to stick to it I&#39;m a very loyal friend and them are proud of the fact that I&#39;ve maintained that a pretty good job of raising my kids so low  okay  great thank you bye bye  okay
636 you just look at Ali so she&#39;s asking a series of questions and then using yes all right  I was born in Philadelphia but we lived all over that the place so I&#39;m not from Philadelphia to just before in there and live there for a year  I love the weather people are generally more friendly than where I&#39;ve lived on the East Coast the scenery the environment the beach the mountains the bike paths and the availability of fresh fruits and vegetables  the usual the traffic I guess some of the people in the entertainment business a bit of the materialism and you know when you meet like the stereotypical deaths  I used to when I used to have a life I been to 41 countries and I really enjoyed that  wish I could do it again one day  I guess since I&#39;m from nowhere it&#39;s fun to go somewhere where  it doesn&#39;t you don&#39;t have to fit in your already a weirdo so it doesn&#39;t matter that you&#39;re not from the place and I just really enjoy eating meeting people from different cultures I love seeing new environments I love seeing historical things are now just things been credible Beauty I love meeting different types of people food I love different food so any foods for money foreign Land Rovers fun and any other thing I secretly like that I try not to get too wrapped up in is that if you can completely and utterly escaped and forget about your real life  how to write let me think for a minute  I don&#39;t know which one to pick  I guess I  I&#39;m trying to think in my head I probably shouldn&#39;t be overthinking I&#39;m trying to think do I pick a horrible one to give you guys more emotion or do I pick a normal what are my traveling companion was my  you know husband too I don&#39;t know what his story is I suppose he&#39;s gay  so we went to to Singapore and it was just fabulous I except for the parts having to deal with him I loved being there and you know the variety of delicious unbelievable food I&#39;m a huge kraylix I&#39;ve been so that was really fun it&#39;s a big shopping place so I kind of wished I were a bit younger cuz they had fabulous fashions  I like the weather cuz it was hot and steamy it was really easy to get around  things like that  let&#39;s see for some reason I&#39;m thinking of a bad one nothing I assume you mean towards travel when I was traveling through Vietnam and Cambodia I got a really bad case of hemorrhoids hemorrhagic dengue fever  I was in hiding  why wasn&#39;t I was in accentuate sorry in Vietnam and I was horribly sick and I was hallucinating and my traveling companion husband person I  I said please go get me some water I was in a really sweating profusely and I&#39;ve been very sick for a while and he went out to get the water I don&#39;t know sometime in the morning and he came back and I don&#39;t know 7 at night or something and said that he some fellow on a motorbike instead let me take you somewhere where you can get some water and I don&#39;t know what the hell you did all day long so I just think back to then and I remember coming in and out of Consciousness and thinking I&#39;m going to die here and I wondered if I would ever be and I found in this hotel we were staying so I don&#39;t know how I survived and I&#39;m probably over dramatizing it but  it was just memorable because I often think back and when I see people sick or whatever and think she why the heck did I survive  that&#39;s not my PTSD thing though if you&#39;re wondering  I studied  film as an undergrad while I started off and dance and then I realized I wasn&#39;t really that talented I mean I was okay but not really that good so I moved over to film and I really enjoyed that and then later on in life I went back to school and I became a lawyer  I&#39;m an underemployed  lawyer I guess I I got tossed out with many people you know I Now understand why the what-do-you-call-it the the age discrimination laws kick in after 40 well you know it&#39;s extremely difficult to get rehired so now I have a couple of clients I make a couple of pennies you know  would prefer to be fully employed not really going so well  so I&#39;m here today to make my 35 measly bucks  does after paying off all those loans and everything for law school because I stupidly took one of the more expensive law schools in the country so many of you students listening don&#39;t do that I mean don&#39;t pick an expensive grad school if you don&#39;t get financial aid and you don&#39;t have a financial help from your family so anyway I because I was spent all my life paying off my undergrad and my graduate schools I now find myself looking down the barrel of long-term unemployment and retirement and not having any you know any insurance or any  enough for a what they say we&#39;re supposed to live to in the future  not anymore I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have any dreams left  when I was younger and my dream job is to be an ambassador because I thought it would just be so much fun to you no have contact with different countries and to get to be friendly and meet people all the time and to represent your country in a positive way  I know I don&#39;t think I have any dreams left I am too old I&#39;ve  I&#39;ve nothing at the world once anymore  well I was always extremely outgoing and friendly up until maybe I don&#39;t know 5 years ago and then I  I guess I&#39;m so friendly and outgoing I just  sometimes I just give up and I don&#39;t even try anymore  well it&#39;s embarrassing when people say what do you do to say you&#39;re unemployed people think I&#39;ve had so many people say well why don&#39;t you just go out and get a job will what are they assume that you&#39;re being lazy or something like that where it&#39;s like okay assholes at work since I was 12 you know right I didn&#39;t have fun during college I worked three jobs to pay for it all and my lungs I don&#39;t know I guess I&#39;d I just stopped trying because and I&#39;m a little embarrassed about my situation you know I&#39;m  quote on quote married to somebody who has this secret life I don&#39;t know what his story is I guess I&#39;m embarrassed about my  my life being so pretty much a complete and utter failure of every every goal that I had  I go for a bike ride along you lovely bike path I go swimming  on occasion I will drink have a drink have a low alcohol tolerance so basically one or two will pretty much knocked me out I don&#39;t know I used to do yoga and stuff like that nowadays I try to do deep breathing  it depends who the person is in a normal situation with normal people or with complete strangers  I&#39;m pretty darn good at it  with two people I&#39;m no longer any good at it at all my husband and my mother cuz they were both extremely  physically and emotionally abusive and I finally learned recently on the last maybe 10 years or so that that&#39;s the stuff they had that I accepted as normal was not normal so I did all the assertiveness thing where you say this is not no please don&#39;t lie to me or whatever the thing they were doing and you know the person supposed to say oh I didn&#39;t know that was hurting you let me change but of course that never actually works in real life so now I find that if I must have contact with these people of HIV one of them have to I get extremely if they lie to me I just get fed up and you know  confront them on it  well  what can you give me a chance I guess it was my husband since I&#39;m paying the cell phone bill and he&#39;s on the family plan it turned out that he had 44 pages of text while he&#39;s off on the secret trip to some summer camp don&#39;t ask I don&#39;t I don&#39;t even want to think about it I don&#39;t know who these people are that he&#39;s texting with so I asked him what the f are you these text who are you doing this with and I tried calling some of the numbers and the people would just hang up on me so you know my imagination started thinking what the hell is he doing at this summer camp why did the people that he&#39;s texting and texting photos to not respond you know draw your own conclusions so you know any wasn&#39;t answering me and he kept lying and he&#39;s one sentence emails he was sending back so I  you know I started getting these threats in the e-mails back like oh yeah well if you don&#39;t tell me I&#39;m going to call up this number and find out who they were which he wouldn&#39;t answer me and then as I said I called and they&#39;re just hung up on me so who knows who these people  well I mean there are the General Life ones like I wish I had never married this person I situation I wish I&#39;d handled differently  I guess I had a job  I actually was a head lawyer for a company probably won&#39;t believe it now you guys were out there watching this and the the president started doing all these things that were ethically wrong and going against my advice and I should have gotten the Hades out of there I should have quit immediately but I was still paying off you know $200,000 worth of student loan so but I just should have gotten out of there  gee willikers  well  I just see the only real thing I feel guilty about is something I prefer not to discuss on tape I mean I&#39;ve had enough drinks tell me over the years that I was justified  hardest decision I tried to make I don&#39;t know I mean every stupid a lot of decisions have been difficult the hardest one I&#39;ve no idea  the last 49 years  I I guess I could erase my big pts State when I was 18 a serial killer  abducted me and I escaped from that I  now I haven&#39;t  I don&#39;t know you know  sing along  I don&#39;t know  neither here nor there I&#39;m just numb anymore I don&#39;t really care I&#39;m just waiting for you know to die  well I kind of had a bad blow last week with something  and  I just didn&#39;t have an appetite for like I don&#39;t know 5 days and horrible thing is I didn&#39;t lose a single pound  I don&#39;t know  let&#39;s say I didn&#39;t have hunger so I didn&#39;t eat and didn&#39;t seem to affect my body at all  well I seem to have developed some horrible neck pain and  that&#39;s made things doubly difficult the second thing is that I because I&#39;m always plagued by these horrible nightmares they&#39;re actually just actual events of actually happen to me just replaying over and over I am an internet addict and I just put stuff on YouTube or or whatever on all night long and you know I frequently have loud loud sounds so I don&#39;t sleep that well and I have a horrible horrible that at the moment and live in a very noisy place  why do I live in a noisy place because I have been unemployed as I told her underemployed as I told you when I don&#39;t have money to live in a place that should be the equal of all the hard work I&#39;ve done in my life  you&#39;re looking at it you know like anybody would be my I don&#39;t feel that well I&#39;m tired I  I don&#39;t know just tired  yes a couple people that I&#39;ve met with have told me that I I had it  the first time I don&#39;t know  maybe 15  the recurring nightmares the  I don&#39;t know I I I developed anxiety and I freaked out you know if I think I&#39;m going to run out of gas I get short of breath and  I don&#39;t know in the soup I used to be able to handle anything now something stupid happens and I catastrophize it and think that it&#39;s going to be horrific so I have to talk myself out of it  hello I&#39;ve lost all the ability to trust and I&#39;m numb to all feelings partly  I will let you know what you said  well you  I think my PTSD I was fine and I had it after the eighteen-year-old incident I just fine and dandy and then something happens in the last like decade I just had hit after hit after hit and it just brought everything back up and or maybe it&#39;s cuz I&#39;m not that busy anymore so I&#39;m time to ruminate over all these horrible things and I&#39;ve said Elaine thing I&#39;m way worse now than I was after the you know escaping from a serial killer I mean  kind of kind of pain in the neck I&#39;ll literally  I&#39;m not being healthy I will  you know  drink a couple things of alcohol which I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know something&#39;s wrong with my heart they told me and  so any more you know even if I have just one causes a lot of pain and stuff or I try to do stuff to relax or you know if I&#39;m having a really really bad day I might  I might it myself or hurt myself and some other way  threat because after you after you do that releases all in all you&#39;re all freaked out and then if you hurt yourself you got really distracted like how come you know this really hurts and then you don&#39;t really think about the horrible thing that was in your head anymore you&#39;re thinking about I&#39;ve got this  I have tried to get help I can&#39;t get any help now I don&#39;t have any insurance I can&#39;t I&#39;m not poor enough I would need to go through all of my retirement savings and be penniless to get any free help so I mean I&#39;d like to be a normal person again and I&#39;d like to be happy I&#39;d like to be a functioning human you know like I used to be  no  I don&#39;t have the money and nobody cares about you know lower-middle-income class people  you know I&#39;ve been to a zillion cerum not a gazillion but you know I don&#39;t know 15 therapist maybe over my 30 years or whatever it is been sometimes you got somebody that&#39;s good  and I found that the younger the person the better actually like a cup one when I was in law school I went to see someone or when my father died when I was 18 at the same time that other thing happens I I saw some students they were actually the best ones the worst ones seem to be the ones that are like in my age category or older cuz it kind of checked out and they just want somebody who&#39;s there but in terms of like I don&#39;t know how I did that young MD whatever think it was called once and  I&#39;m really work sometimes you get a new gets like wants some therapist said to me you don&#39;t want to kill yourself you just want a different life so when I am suicidal I just think of that sends I don&#39;t want to kill myself I just want a different life so is sometimes you get a nougat but you know generally it hasn&#39;t really saved me yet  do I have to I just did sometimes you get us a good therapist oh one thing I learned is that most therapists are actually more screwed up than me you know I may seem screwed up to you guys here but you know at least I used to be able to function I was somewhat successful and I I&#39;ve never intentionally hurt people I don&#39;t screw people over I&#39;m not dishonest in my work compassionate and I found so many therapists you know they live their little teeny lives in Suburbia or whatever the heck they&#39;re from and they&#39;re totally incapable of  relating to anything that&#39;s outside of their world  I haven&#39;t been as I told you so but I did go I noticed that it was fun to go somewhere once a week and have somebody listen to your for Tales of Woe although sometimes it got frustrating the person was not helpful  really happy  I&#39;ve been trying to cultivate it the last night I was on the bike path and I looked around at the beautiful nature things and there were briefs literally seconds where I had it and then him some aggressive bike ride or somebody else to come along and that would be destroyed but otherwise more than perhaps a brief second or a couple of seconds  I don&#39;t even know I don&#39;t even know oh oh oh  it is good  oh my God are you even listening  I don&#39;t think you&#39;re listening very carefully you like some of the strings I&#39;ve had  people is that what you wanted me to tell you about I  I don&#39;t even know what the question was anymore to tell you the truth  sorry  no just the empty silence that I&#39;m supposed to be filling to answer or you  what was the question  I don&#39;t know sometimes therapies helpful sometimes it&#39;s not  show the happiness that was a question sometimes I&#39;ve had half my happiest moment was when I climbed up inside the Great Pyramid of Giza that was extremely hot I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just wonderful  wonderful feeling I&#39;m claustrophobic so I was proud that I made it through there and it was just an amazing sight  Cassius is a test to see how one reacts when there&#39;s an uncomfortable silence  am I supposed to be pushing the button for the person to come in now  all right she did stop talking  I thought it was a test of how one reacts during an uncomfortable side

want to come down  I also do a meditation and self-hypnosis  I try  it depends on how I&#39;m feeling or how upset I am or how, I&#39;m trying to be  if I&#39;m really upset it&#39;s a lot harder for you to come down and bring myself down through meditation or through self hypnosis  but yeah  I&#39;m all right I did it sometimes I lose it  I yell when I lose my temper and I have put holes in walls  not yet  last night my mom got an argument it was  about me buying a ticket last night for the Greyhound to go to Utah  what made you decide to do  I&#39;m going up there to work for a few weeks and

back and I just want to make sure she doesn&#39;t  okay  okay  okay alrighty  yes  I&#39;m doing well  I&#39;m a born and raised in Los Angeles California  I love the weather the diversity of the people that are here and just a sense of Entrepreneurship that you can accomplish anything if you&#39;re from LA  the smog and pollution it definitely it is extremely congested and maybe too much of the Hollywood persona  not as much as I&#39;d like to but I have traveled a bit  sing something new I would like to see everything that my eyes can explore so experiencing new cultures and new environments  okay the last trip that I can think of that I went on was to North Carolina which is somewhere that I lived before I went back to visit for a weekend and it was kind of like a party welcome home back time and then I came back to LA  having my children I was I would probably be the most memorable experiences I&#39;ve had I had both of my children natural childbirth without any medication so quite memorable  in high school I was in a music Magnum I was a dancer and I sang a bit but primarily dance and in college my major is business with entrepreneurial I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve stopped in college right now but I want to pursue business  what do you do now  primarily stay at home with my newborn baby while she&#39;s not a newborn she&#39;s 9 months now and I just work part-time mostly from home  my dream job would definitely incorporate helping people on some type of platform may be working for a non-profit but where I could really juggle and balance being at home taking care of my family and incorporating that with providing a service that provides income  I consider myself pretty outgoing  I make direct eye contact I&#39;m not afraid to engage in conversation with people I enjoy meeting new people and conversation so I think that just really being willing to actually go out and talk and Explorer makes me all going  I have my mother I was raised with and my sister will 10 years younger than me those remind me dear family and my own family as I have a 12 year old son a 9 month old daughter and my boyfriend is my current family that I live with and I&#39;m very close to my family  I do like to read sometimes it definitely listen to music same thing just try to get my mind away I enjoy all types of music or sometimes I play games on my computer or just playing with my kids  needs Improvement for sure I think that I displayed too much email emotion be a good or bad so I was have a little bit of a temper  the last time I argue with someone was over the weekend and it was with my boyfriend and it was really about contemplating breaking up and moving away from each other  in most arguments when I reflect back the main thing that I wish I would handle differently is not losing my cool controlling my temper I wish that even In the Heat of the Moment that this is the temperament and type of communication that I use  I guess making what I feel like our bad decisions not being able to provide enough for my children or not feeling like I am where I&#39;m capable of being a should be at this point in life  I feel guilty about not making the right financial and career choices at this point in life so far  I also feel  the hardest decision I ever had to make was  whether to go to a memorial for my aunt or to work that I guess in retrospect wasn&#39;t including but really it was a decision for me on business or family and I chose family and it&#39;s made me  really really be more aware of my family and not let a corporation or a job control me  I would say  an event or space or something I could have raised for my memory would be a 911 the whole experience of 9/11 and I wish I could erase it for the entire country  yes  I was 19 years old when I&#39;m in the military  I got being born and raised in Los Angeles I kind of feel that a very free spirit and I&#39;d say maybe hippie personality and when I graduated from high school I just felt that I wasn&#39;t reaching my potential and thought I could help myself by trying to establish some discipline I thought that was something that the military put off for me and it did  I am happy that I did that that I served my country and that I actually enlisted  yes kind of I was in Saudi Arabia when 9/11 happen and ended up serving as  support for the air portion of the war was being it&#39;s his was being it happened it was happening from Saudi Arabia  not very easy I think that was a very very hard time or scary time to be away from my family my son was only 12 months when I left 13 months when I left at the time it was very hard to adjust to get back to establishing trust with him again and just from being gone for 4 months it was difficult to readjust with such a big thing that had affected our entire country and in the entire world  after the military I started working for the restaurant industry I became a restaurant manager and eventually a training manager and ran I&#39;m training for a restaurant for for the house and back of house employees all aspects of the restaurant  I think it made me a lot more  aggressive I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the best word to use may be confident I&#39;m very aware of eye contact paying attention to detail and timeliness things of that nature I&#39;d say the positive factors of the military are being very disciplined and again paying attention to detail  lately I&#39;ve been pretty hard on myself I haven&#39;t been working much just taking care of the baby and I&#39;m really really trying to figure out which direction I went next in life howling forward  I don&#39;t feel like I have been as positive as I used to be  I feel like I need a lot more encouragement I feel like I&#39;m a lot more needy and clingy Than I Used to Be however at the same time I&#39;ve been isolating myself a whole lot more than I usually do  it depends on what&#39;s happening with my daughter if my baby is awake I&#39;m awake when she sleeps I sleep  tired of probably a little cranky as well  you know I&#39;ve been talking to a therapist for about the past 3 months I have not had a full psychological evaluation but she definitely said I was just playing fine of PTSD depression and anxiety  yes same therapist again says that she feels that I&#39;m experiencing signs and showing signs of depression  definitely what I had my baby 9 months ago really happy lately I can&#39;t think of an exact time or experience  my grandmother has been a very positive influence in my life my mother have expended a lot of strong women I look up to have been very powerful influences on my life  my best friend would probably describe me as a free spirit  very loving loyal  and a  I don&#39;t know maybe I&#39;m predictable  well on the 4th of July I took my baby out to the park and just played with bubbles I know that&#39;s a little but that really makes me happy spend time with my kids and just being in the moment and being still and feel like I have no needs to be met just enjoying my time with my children  I am most proud of Taking Chances even though I think I&#39;m hard on myself sometimes I think

417 thank you  creative  I&#39;m pleased  are you okay  yes  I&#39;m okay  a Los Angeles  I don&#39;t know  kind of dirty but that&#39;s to be expected from a big city  my the last class I need to go to Sociology class I&#39;m not really sure where I&#39;m going with school but I&#39;m thinking about sex education  how did you do  I think that is a really important job I feel like  because there&#39;s kind of a  Stigmata guess about talking about sex at leads to like a lot of unsafe sex more than planned pregnancies so I feel like it&#39;s a very important job for  the world  I don&#39;t know  okay  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  lack of funds  it depends on the people but I&#39;d say that generally more shy of course of people who I know well like we&#39;re closer to me I am more outgoing  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling  the best of guy  play with my dogs  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a nice day I&#39;ll go for a walk if it&#39;s not a nice day then or if it&#39;s like cold out or something then maybe watch a show on TV I like or read a book or something  I&#39;d say I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my temper  I can&#39;t remember I think the last person I argue with was my boyfriend probably last week but I don&#39;t even remember what it was about  you feel guilty about  I don&#39;t think I really feel guilty about anything I say that I regret things but I think there&#39;s a difference between guilt and regret  like I think guilt is more just like feeling bad but regret is like feeling like you should have made a different decision and I think that can help you in to make better decisions in the future where is guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it&#39;s useless  I regret not doing better when I was in high school  I mean not getting better grades I regret  Blake getting involved with certain people in the past but I mean I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s about it that I can think of right now  you done anything to avoid  yeah I mean I mean in the past yeah I could have made different decisions I mean obviously some things you know you aren&#39;t entirely in your control but I&#39;m not going to feel I&#39;m not going to regret things that I had no power over so  I&#39;m not sure if I would want to erase it from my memory  but  I wish that it didn&#39;t happen to me was a time that I was raped  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to make  I can&#39;t really think of any hard decisions  I can&#39;t think of any  okay  tell me about  I&#39;m not sure I can&#39;t think of any  I have a pretty good relationship with my family not I wouldn&#39;t say that I&#39;m really close with my mother but I mean we get along well and I&#39;m very close to my sister we&#39;re basically best friends  I think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life  because she was always able to provide for me and she always she didn&#39;t like mistake sometimes but I think that she was always there for me when I needed it and she just did her best to raise me so I think she was a big positive influence  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it&#39;s been easy lately sometimes I have trouble sleeping but  lately I have had no problems  it depends how long I&#39;ve gone without sleep I can just be anywhere from like groggy to Lake really on edge  and like  extremely tired  I have been feeling pretty good I have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it&#39;s not as bad as it has been  in the past  so  I&#39;m feeling mostly pretty good  I think that I&#39;ve actually been feeling happier lately  I want to say that I&#39;m like really happy all the time I mostly just kind of  like a neutral but I have been feeling more positive lately  I&#39;m actually not sure if I have been diagnosed with PTSD  tell me about  I know that I&#39;ve been seeing a psychologist for like since I was 16 for depression and I think my first psychologist who I saw for a few years thought that I had PTSD but I&#39;m not sure if she ever made a diagnosis  did you think you had a problem before you found out  I&#39;m not sure  I don&#39;t know  yes  it&#39;s helpful to talk someone and have them kind of  guide you in talking about something so that you can figure things this figure out your feelings about things sort of I guess for yourself or like why it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you&#39;re feeling a certain way about something I mean I think sometimes you can do that on your own but talking to somebody helps I think  not sure  I&#39;m not sure  I&#39;m not sure  I think I would spend it mostly at home  but it would be sunny out and I would go outside a little bit and and play with my dogs and  I probably have my boyfriend over  I eat food that I like like only through that I like like my favorite foods watch  movie or TV show that I like just  kind of have like a relaxing time but that&#39;s nice  I would tell myself to  to to do better in school because throat High School is kind of an underachiever and I ended up going to Community College like on and off because I would like to have lose interest and then not do well or as well as I could have so I would tell myself to do as well as I could in school because I feel like I am capable of a lot more than I do and I think I could easily have gone missing a scholarship if I have done well in high school so I just tell myself to do good in school and probably wore myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time  I think I am proud of myself for not being bitter and for wanting to live kind of bitter and yes but I guess I&#39;m proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to make the world a better place like cuz a lot of bad things have happened to me and I tried to instead instead of dwell on them I try to or I want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as I want to help I guess Empower people to make their lives better
368 the shoes you know why did you do that a lot of things like that you right  I guess you&#39;re right  start it up for you  she can start chatting with you I&#39;m going to put the doorbell back over here so when she&#39;s  hi  and please  are you okay with this  yeah I&#39;m okay with it  I&#39;m okay I&#39;m okay I guess  I&#39;m basically an l a kind of guy  things you really like about la  you know the weather it&#39;s usually pretty sunny and contemporary you know I like that the climate really a lot of the girls here you know I like let&#39;s see I don&#39;t like the traffic you know but I like the Hispanic population quite a bit you know  and I have a lot of friends here so I guess you know I don&#39;t want to be anywhere else  like I said the traffic you know I was on the phone with 500 that&#39;s always kind of in a crummy the cost of living that&#39;s really you know terrible but it&#39;s always expensive and you know I really don&#39;t like  I really don&#39;t like you know I can just seems like I&#39;m always one of those places were like you know you have like a ton of money and fame and fortune or like you know you&#39;re down and you know that the ghettos you know  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I have I&#39;ve been to a couple places you know book very brief in a Multiverse for school I want Arizona and New York in Montana anthropology like you know and archaeology field trips and things like that that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing right now  I like getting away from the city you know I was in Yosemite last year in Ohio in the summer for vacation that was kind of nice you know your family was really really need to see but you&#39;re busy getting away from the city I guess you&#39;re not getting away from the job getting away from the stress here  I actually studied political science and I also studied economics I&#39;m a big kind of political you know junkie you know that begin with for a natural Valentine with that kind of field of study  I was I was but I lost my job and you know that&#39;s kind of a bummer you know the last it&#39;s cheese it&#39;s only been maybe a year and a half an hour maybe two years and you know the condom got bad and the budget cuts got bad and you know I wish I was working there again  I love my job you could almost say it&#39;s virtually made for me  well I wanted to be a lawyer one time I want to be a lawyer in a and that&#39;s why I took political science and I took a double major in economics and the sad thing is the sad thing is that a you know what to get into law school to take the entrance exam called the Alsace and I study for a leg really hard core you know it for about a year and I took the test and like an idiot I didn&#39;t feel right about that that day it was kind of an off-day and you know it&#39;s like going to the big game of the Super Bowl by just don&#39;t I don&#39;t feel like I did well and I cancel the test and so on  do I kind of regret that you know  tell me about it  I&#39;m not really shy at all I&#39;m definitely not shy but outgoing and me not one of these people not flamboyant you know I&#39;ll talk to people I don&#39;t mind talking to people I don&#39;t mind meeting people that&#39;s fine with me but it&#39;s not like I&#39;m you know Dinan to kind of meet anybody  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but  I guess  these days you know I play guitar and I taught myself how to play guitar thank you thank you I should actually be doing more of it but I also like to exercise I&#39;m going to die right now but my dad&#39;s been terrible time eating habits have been terrible but the exercise part is just great I love to X I love to run that&#39;s one of my best things to do for stress is the ground and they pop workout I just wish that my eating habits where we&#39;re in line we&#39;re a little bit better you know  okay  my temper could be you know definitely improved a lot you know I&#39;m in a lot of times I I feel I&#39;m one of these introvert types person when it comes to let you know I don&#39;t mind being an extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever we know what I&#39;m mad I really don&#39;t want to be you no talking to people I don&#39;t like to yell I don&#39;t have to scream but I&#39;d like to hear I don&#39;t like to fight a kind of close down a lot I don&#39;t know what you want to be left alone sometimes I tend to drag it on for longer than it should be in the wife doesn&#39;t like it too much and maybe you know I just don&#39;t I just want to talk him I just don&#39;t want to deal with it it kind of close down and shut you know  shut off for a little bit  cheese doesn&#39;t happen too often  maybe with my wife you know it&#39;ll probably be something silly who knows  who knows  the thing is I don&#39;t have a lot of guilt I don&#39;t do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know I&#39;m there are things that like you know call my nersons you know I get white lies or whatever you know what like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty  can you give me an example of a  let&#39;s see I guess sometimes you know you know I&#39;m very guy but you know sometimes the times you know I like to smile a girl or like you know get a girl&#39;s attention you know I don&#39;t know I never do anything about it never get the phone number you know but sometimes I like to like talk to people I guess you know  and that you wish you would handle different  well that&#39;s a good question I guess  I guess you know I always have to look the same but does not I don&#39;t ever wish to deliver to ever change it and never wanted to handle things differently I always kind of I&#39;m pretty comfortable the way I handle things and you know I think that I could be a lot worse than like you no shouting and screaming and hitting in this and that and that&#39;s just not me you know I think the best thing to do you know it&#39;s kind of like get a lot of breathing room a lot of space and I don&#39;t wish for that to change or to handle any that differently I just don&#39;t really know what else to do you know and you know the last thing I want to do is start talking about you no feelings or any of this you know that&#39;s the last thing I want to do and so like I don&#39;t wish that I handle things like that differently in that way  tell me about your relationship with your family  well you know I&#39;m pretty happy with my family right now you know if I&#39;m married and we have a baby along the way which is kind of nice if some cats thank you thank you if cats and a dog a weenie dog and my mom I love my mom dearly she has diabetes which you know she doesn&#39;t control you know she doesn&#39;t control it and like it like FX4 health and nose has me worried about her and I stressing out about her and she could do so much too late for vented and she doesn&#39;t sand  you know I have a good relationship with my mom I love her dearly and actually have a good relationship with everybody I think I think I have a ton of family and friends get along with me pretty well actually you know  there are times I mean it&#39;s pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually I feel like you know I sleep like a baby the only problem I have I think is I feel like you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you just going to sleep and you can kind of like you know like you almost kind of looked for it is like I was falling sensation or something like that and it didn&#39;t happen that often but it happens and before the most time apart when I sleep like a really good  well right now generally I&#39;ve been feeling worried and anxious and you know intense the reason why is because I see my mom right rallies today but found out my mom something she didn&#39;t tell me the whole story and I&#39;m kind of waiting to this is over so we can I can find out what&#39;s wrong with her but you know I&#39;m worried about her she&#39;s she&#39;s at the doctor&#39;s right now so that doesn&#39;t tell me anything good and you know I&#39;m trying to find a job so that has me worried too and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so I feel like you know overwhelmed with a just a lot of like you know things to do in like and  and I&#39;m a lot on my plate in like a lot of it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with me but I have to handle it like you know so like I guess  well I keep myself distracted I keep myself busy I feel like a busybody you know the more you know it seems like it&#39;s not a good thing because I feel like I&#39;m just adding more things on my plate so you know like one of things I do is like exercising so I have to workout everyday you know what that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know chicken change you need to start raining in Lagos to the whole thing of stretching and cooling down at 6 to take some time and then they can shower and all that kind of stuff to it takes time so it but I have to do a daily do I cope with it and that way I also cope with it to you know playing guitar but that&#39;s just more of a distraction you know what I mean keeping keeping busy that way it&#39;s just seems like it&#39;s not you know I&#39;m working towards you know the goals you know that I need to do let you know if I find another job which I should be doing but then  in all it&#39;s one of those things were like I find that there&#39;s no good jobs I&#39;ve been looking and looking like something that I do it it&#39;s just not what I want to do it just doesn&#39;t seem like I want to do is Lay terrible jobs  you know it&#39;s it&#39;s  probably harder than I&#39;m thinking about it because sometimes I feel like you know one of these things is like  I feel like it is hard but it&#39;s not I mean they&#39;re always I can cope with it you know I just got out of a kind of accepted it a lot you know I can&#39;t internalize it and like you know it&#39;s not something that&#39;s like I&#39;m out on the street or anything like that but you know it is a worry  I&#39;ve never been diagnosed with PTSD I used to work with  no  tell me about the last time you felt  man  10 years ago the last time was really happy maybe  me nothing I feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know I learned a new song on the guitar I feel like not even happy about that you know I feel like I&#39;m you know I work out something that kind of makes me happy no running like you know fast and working out but that doesn&#39;t make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good you know so I have these these These Times where I&#39;m just you know feeling good about myself in a feeling you know but I&#39;m never feeling great I&#39;m never feeling happy and they were feeling like so sensationalize like you know and and and you know incredible that you know it&#39;s just another mile times where there&#39;s a few good times you know in a few bad times with a good times and never extremes you know never really good times and never really see no choices baddest X you know  well I wish this is Diet would work out a little bit better you know but that&#39;s kind of hard you know cuz I&#39;m the kind of guy who just likes who just likes you know you know why you like Mexican food makes you know I&#39;m a snack and I don&#39;t know I just feel like that could I could change I wish I could change my eating habits that way I can let you know cuz I work out so much I feel like I do so much money and so much activity that like you know that if I got my tight and check you know that was also can change you know  my my I guess my my desire to like you know get a head like right now I feel just so like the kind of me so bad and like things are so unwell that you know it&#39;s like pointless to even like you know look for these kind of jobs like it just seems like I just wish I had a little more inspiration and motivation to like to  do things  the one thing I regret is is not is not you know it&#39;s this LSAT thing you know you know  not passing the test again with cuz I&#39;m sure I could have got into it at school but then again later you know it has me thinking like do I really want to pay once you let you know Law School tuition and the cost of that and then you know just to just to be power down with more work and things like that I don&#39;t know it just didn&#39;t seem like like  there is this idea of justice and and and republicanism and you know things that I really ain&#39;t here to that I fall in love with a that I don&#39;t want to get away from but it&#39;s just seems like it&#39;s a ton of work and money and just too late for the smallest percentage of success it that you know you might not be able to do in that kind of feel you might and you know it just didn&#39;t seem like like it&#39;s worth overcoming the obstacles I need to overcome  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  I have no idea I would have 20 years ago I would tell myself maybe  and I think I&#39;ve done everything really well for myself except for the outside thing you know which I regret on one hand on the other hand you know I&#39;m not sure if I regret cuz what the bills and all that kind of stuff I told you about and I think you know I&#39;ve waited to get married and waited to have a kid you know pretty cautious about this is why I don&#39;t take drugs I don&#39;t drink I don&#39;t fight I don&#39;t do any of these things that let you know that I think that real people have him in and they really like you to ruin their life you know it&#39;s like I&#39;m pretty happy and content with being in or the cautious you know I don&#39;t know  okay  how do your best friend describe you all my best friend I think he kind of his likes me he wishes that I would do more things with him but he works at night and you know it&#39;s one of the things I think most people not just my best friend but my wife and remind me the rest of my family so that I don&#39;t put a lot of time and attention to them and they think that I&#39;m pretty great when you give them the time of day and my attention but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m really there all the time you know I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m really you know I&#39;m always thinking about something else I don&#39;t know if I really can give him a real you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you don&#39;t usually do it you know but I almost feel like it&#39;s like a chore like you know Legacy you know if they really need me then I&#39;ll do it you know if it&#39;s just asking for a favor I almost felt you know I do have a lot of lackluster that I have hardness I just  it&#39;s not because I hate him I feel like I&#39;m their friend makes them somehow you know like it makes me think you know the times I think I don&#39;t want them down the aisle my friends but it&#39;s the same time I just feel like it&#39;s it&#39;s more it&#39;s not it&#39;s not it&#39;s more like a chore to do instead of a  willingness like it oh my God like I just want to help you is that it&#39;s never like that it&#39;s just something that I do because I kind of have to do you know you got to go to do things for your friends you know in the end because of your friends you know and I do like them and they probably would do it for me and I know so I just do the things you know just  what are you most proud of in your life  well there are a couple of things that I do like that I could feel good about myself you and I ran the LA Marathon that kind of felt good you know I&#39;ve graduated from college that kind of feels good do you know what I mean but the thing is I don&#39;t feel like like that proud of myself for you know those things alone like graduated from college you know has it really made me successful you don&#39;t need me running the marathon hasn&#39;t made me sit there like half merits you know we&#39;re like the great in or may not have

303 wow okay  when you&#39;re finished when she&#39;s done  okay  thank you  how are you doing today okay how about yourself  here in California  all well that is big and bras a lot to do a lot of  I&#39;m job opportunities than other states pretty much that is big and it&#39;s a lot you can do here  traffic Maybe  the violence right the bad news even though you don&#39;t even want to know what&#39;s going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what&#39;s going on on a daily basis  sociology I have a  2 year degree in Liberal Arts but my major was sociology  no I&#39;m actually MTA bus operator  what&#39;s your  well since Metro is study growing my dream job is to move up in the company and I&#39;m about to actually start some classes for supervisor free next week so cuz they look to promote within the company so that&#39;s a good thing is a lot of opportunities at Metro where you can take classes in their pay for your tuition and things of that nature  thanks  well it&#39;s not actually hard as right now is easy if you take advantage of it right now cuz they look to promote within so you know since I&#39;m already working there that&#39;s a good thing so is good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you&#39;re interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean I&#39;m sorry  okay  free take a long walk hot bath  meditate just close my eyes sometimes  okay  I&#39;m pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you got to remain calm and still remain professional at the same time  well I look at it like it it goes with a Ami comes with experience you know you do something on a continuous basis usually you somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so I I look at it like that so I&#39;ve been driving for years and dealing with the public so it&#39;s just how you handle circumstances how you treat people like you want to be treated  I&#39;m pretty good at it now maybe when I were younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and I&#39;m still learning today  I will say my family you know my kids so you know even though you don&#39;t have been having a lot of deaths around me but that&#39;s just that&#39;s part of the  life experience you know you born here but you got to leave here one day but  my kids will keep me you don&#39;t saying and you know I love them in my family  thank you  no  set good examples you know because you&#39;re the first teacher you know and you want to set a positive good example for your kids and I think that&#39;s a good thing and it starts at home  well  by you being the first teacher your kids you&#39;re that you&#39;re you&#39;re the one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever&#39;s been taught in the home they looking and learn everyday you know brother is that homeschool you know kids have a tendency to do things with a c you know what I mean so you try to keep it positive teaching good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature  I have a 4 1/2 year old son I have a seven-year-old daughter and I also have a 23 year old  yeah I&#39;m about to be well my daughter&#39;s pregnant with the boy she has three little girls go have three grand kids and one on the way which is the boy this time  yeah thank you  the hardest thing is we&#39;re right now I&#39;m a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and  they can be expensive at times you know and depends on the person&#39;s situation you know whether they have helped or job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it&#39;s hard you know but you are trying to keep a job you know keep food in the house you know just maintaining support my kids the best way I can  with my kids or Just.  what&#39;s memorable for me is that I&#39;m the only one in my family with a degree so it&#39;s kind of like yeah it&#39;s kind of even though I&#39;m the baby of 10 kids you know and I always kept in the back of my mind even though everybody will pretty much my whole family have decent job but I&#39;m the one with the degree so I kind of like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know I just that&#39;s the only thing I remember and graduating you know and my family is there to support me  thank you  happy that I accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just having a high school diploma and I had I was working on my bachelors degree but I ended up in a bad car accident I never went back I got distracted and you know I was working at the same time but I was just like more so I needed income then then I&#39;m schooling at that time because I was a young parent you know cuz I have my daughter at 17 so I was like I made it the money to support her but I never went back but I feel like it&#39;s never too late so I feel like I take some classes now that I&#39;m with Metro to help me move up the ladder so that&#39;s why I&#39;m starting my class next week  thank you  well device I would have gave myself  then I probably would have been a young mother at a young age and that  I probably wouldn&#39;t  stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not I would have remained in school I probably would have had kids early you know  whether I probably would have stayed in school and probably have a part-time job or something just I just feel like education is an excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learn different things keep your mind open to learning new ideas every day so I think that&#39;s a plus you know and anybody shoes that&#39;s the better they sells you know through education maybe two maybe promote within your company or whatever the case maybe they help better your career  I&#39;m quite sure you learn from your mistakes you know you but the same time you don&#39;t continue to make the same ones I feel like it&#39;s okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know like myself even though I&#39;m going to school late but still I&#39;m going you know I want to better myself career-wise so  yes  my oldest daughter  we had an argument because  the life she&#39;s living right now in the things that she&#39;s going through and I had told her that she just need to make some changes to better her situation and I&#39;ll we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don&#39;t want to hear it you know here&#39;s the stuff that you&#39;re saying even though  is true or  or they just you know quote they just don&#39;t want to hear it you know they may be going through something they don&#39;t want to hear but we got into argument about it but  lettuce happened you know  I just told her my I&#39;m sorry  very close very close is that the situation my daughter&#39;s name right now she just needs to make some changes to better her her life  and I&#39;ve been  she kind of like stubborn in their own way you know I was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom is not going to tell you nothing wrong and I&#39;ve been telling her over the years you know different things and it&#39;s kind of like I was talking to a wall because she did the opposite and now she&#39;s she regretting it you know cuz she&#39;s like my mom told me that I&#39;m doing the opposite so I guess you got a bump her head a couple of times to get it it&#39;s kind of like I didn&#39;t told you I left it alone and now it&#39;s up to you to make the change  how hot is it  it&#39;s very frustrating because it&#39;s like I&#39;m talking to a wall and she&#39;s not hearing me and I&#39;m like it seems like it&#39;s taking forever for the change but it&#39;s left up to the individual when they&#39;re ready you know what I mean one supposed to get tired of something they make a change it may not be when you wanted to have him but  the ball is in her Court you know  only can do so much  oh wow  Oh my days  since I have two little ones my kind of like trying to go to bed at 8 because you know they got to go to school and I think it&#39;s important have a good night&#39;s rest because it kind of like  it it kind of like I guess you&#39;re ready for the next day or you know how you going to feel if you rested what type of person going to be that day you know cuz everybody have their days you know rather than good or bad but that&#39;s just part of life and I feel like if you had a good night good good night rest hopefully you have a good day you know  pretty much you know I need my rest because I&#39;m out there driving a bus and dealing with all these people and you know the job is stuff is very stressful so I feel like if I&#39;m rested and it helped me  what am I like irritated tired lazy  you know  feel like I want to lay down probably go to sleep  never thought about that you know  cuz like I said you know everybody had a moment to do  I thought about that  no  no  okay  how your best friend describe you I don&#39;t really have a best friend but person that I deal with it I used to work with she&#39;ll probably tell you that I&#39;m very outgoing a go-getter Dependable responsible  I&#39;m a people person  I get along with others you know I&#39;m kind of like  I live in a good Mark  whether I know you are not if you was to you know like like you and I now you know I I I  you probably sell she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that  thank you  well  I try to stay happy I rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what I mean  especially when I go to pick him up from school or just up to me  thank you  you&#39;re more than welcome you have a good day  goodbye  you&#39;re welcome  okay  that is so interesting
413 okay and please  are you okay with this yes  I&#39;m doing okay  I&#39;m from Greenwich Connecticut  yes  I moved here in 2008 so about 5 years ago  I try to go back at least once a year sometimes I go more sometimes less  overall I think I like where I&#39;m from better than La in general  that other than it being somewhere I&#39;m familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what I&#39;m used to and less superficial  I understand  Monument  all my move got here for college after I graduated high school and my mom and sister live in California  initially it was easy because I felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally  Fine Arts in photography  I was interested in photography since high school, I did a lot of programs and got Awards and things like that and publishments so I decided to pursue art  yes I have a fine arts degree that I got last year and  awesome  are you happy you did that yeah I really enjoy working or interning in forensics I like that better than initially what I wanted to do was freelance photography I feel like it&#39;s a more secure job and it&#39;s very interesting  Centrist in question  I guess just my childhood in general growing up  while my family is very close  my extended family as well and they all most of them live  within the area on the east coast in general so we would always do large family parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that  yeah it is really fun and we try and I&#39;ll get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries  I consider myself more shy  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling  hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  what do you do  I watch reality television I think it&#39;s kind of funny and lighthearted  like what I watch Like Bravo TV like The Real Housewives shows and  like funny things that you don&#39;t really need to pay attention to  I&#39;m good I guess I don&#39;t really have like a temper from having if I&#39;m more stressed out it definitely shows in my attitude but I don&#39;t have like anger  when was the last time you argue with someone  will me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time just like about like insignificant things but other than that I had an argument with my dad a few days ago  can you tell me about  does Ben like some tension going on  since I went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that I should be the one to make some kind of effort to  have a relationship with her although he doesn&#39;t for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the 30th time he we were on the phone and he was  telling me how I need to call her and speak to her and I told him that I was going to do it over this past weekend cuz of the Jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me you&#39;ll forget it she doesn&#39;t want to hear from you now and kind of just like I could care less because I I don&#39;t care about having a relationship with her so she doesn&#39;t want to hear from me you know it&#39;s easier for me  I mean every time I mean that&#39;s been the same recurring argument a lot and I wish  that I could sometimes I do but I wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that I could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or thinks he knows that like will take me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn&#39;t be saying to me so he so I kind of just like lose it and I can&#39;t really  like not say anything  well I guess the hardest decision I made which I didn&#39;t really realize that it&#39;s the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to go after you graduate high school where you go to college because for me I&#39;ve basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own  so it didn&#39;t seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like the progression of The Next Step but looking back now that&#39;s probably one of the hardest decisions I made  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  I wish I could erase  the event or seeing my grandmother&#39;s funeral which obviously it wouldn&#39;t change anything but  it wasn&#39;t seeing her there was not something I&#39;d want to like have in my memory  come she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental  and now I mean my parents are great role models just in general I mean they&#39;re very successful people  so whether or not we have like disagreements or that were separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you want to have when you are older  usually it&#39;s easy the problem is staying asleep no matter how late I go to bed whether it&#39;s 10 p.m. or 4 a.m. I will be up like clockwork by 7:30 or 8 in the morning the latest every single day and I can&#39;t seem to figure out why I cannot stay asleep longer  I need to record buy something no I just in the morning I guess I&#39;m a lighter sleeper but I just wake up like I just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this is consistent but now it&#39;s I cannot remember the last time I slept past 8:30 in the morning  I mean it just makes if I have to do stuff during the day and makes a lot more tiring but it doesn&#39;t really I&#39;m so used to it now it doesn&#39;t really change my mood it&#39;s just part of every day  okay  how you doing lately  I don&#39;t know I kind of just feel very  like so so just  no extreme highs no extreme lows kind of one no land  I mean nothing like lately  like recently it&#39;s just I would say over a. Of years I kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and  not very outgoing  no  no I have been diagnosed with anxiety  I had some breathing problems for a day or two and I had to go to the hospital cuz I thought it was more serious cuz I couldn&#39;t breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety  I think in the right setting and  with the person who&#39;s doing it if they&#39;re open-minded and the therapist  is helpful  and good at what they&#39;re doing then yeah  no I haven&#39;t been to therapy since I was a kid  I went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me  but it was never so I mean we just sat around and talked about my day wasn&#39;t it I didn&#39;t feel like I needed therapy at the time so I didn&#39;t really get much out of it  tell me about  I was happy when I was back home at my boyfriend&#39;s house with his family over the New Year&#39;s holiday when I&#39;m there I can always just we save up our money so it&#39;s a complete vacation I don&#39;t have to worry about paying bills I don&#39;t have to worry about what I have to do tomorrow who I have to deal with I just do every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day  is there anything you regret  in general  I regret the college I chose to go to I didn&#39;t leave from the East Coast the whole Collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the university is out there or not the same as like the tight-knit California school system out here so when I was researching colleges I kind of thought that Santa Monica College was just a general College just like Boston College back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it I didn&#39;t realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can&#39;t I didn&#39;t even realize you couldn&#39;t get a bachelor&#39;s degree from there when I went so kind of crate created more problems for me  well cuz they&#39;re M22 if probably 10 years ago I would give myself the advice to  probably stay closer to home and 2ave really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to California  how your best friend describe you  my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren&#39;t my good friends would describe me  which I mean I don&#39;t I mean it is what it is I  I am very outgoing in and have a great time when I&#39;m with my friend in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things I just  I am very shy and  don&#39;t really  speak match  recently my friend was visiting and we went to a Clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed that  I&#39;m very caring I am a very good judge of character which I mean I guess it&#39;s I mean I consider to be a quality for myself and various I mean never affectionate I&#39;m more  I mean I guess I guess so  thanks  experience I can chat with you a little bit more about
478 okay  yes  all good things  the East Coast  for work  I rarely  I prefer it out here  it&#39;s not as nice as the lifestyle out here I like the weather better and there&#39;s a lot of things about living here my favorite city so  somewhat  baby sleep  what&#39;s that  just stop I like to go to France a lot I like the food there and just a lifestyle the shopping that sort of thing  art history and marketing  avail  I became interested in high school and I thought it was a good classical education and I interned a Dandy Warhols magazine when I was in high school and so that  yes  yes  I&#39;m pretty happy with what I&#39;m I&#39;m doing I do Consulting so I write marketing plans that sort of thing  it&#39;s really hard  about writing a marketing plan  I know it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard to talk to someone about who&#39;s not marketing it requires just knowledge of you know how it&#39;s how it how it&#39;s done and it takes several months to to do lunch  well I guess I&#39;m originally kind of shy but I become more outgoing just cuz of work and stuff  I like to exercise I do hiking with my dogs we walk up and down a hill a couple times is that  good  I don&#39;t remember  I don&#39;t know nothing comes to mind  sometimes I don&#39;t I don&#39;t clean my car it might get lots of dog hair in it and I feel bad when I tie should always stay on top of that just getting to the carwash and stuff  well I had a conflict with my brother and so I had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense in that was a difficult decision but just because of his angry behavior wasn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t that difficult but you know what it was somewhat difficult because I I love him very much so  I&#39;m not close to my family so my I don&#39;t really have one  I have a Japanese friends I think the center came up I have a Japanese friend I&#39;m very close but she&#39;s like my kind of my mother and  I just met him socially  I don&#39;t know nothing comes to mind  yeah I think the sensor came off  Ohio  okay okay  easy cuz I keep a regular schedule  I&#39;m just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable  a good  well I&#39;m recovering from PTSD so I sometimes feel that the PTSD and then I&#39;ll take a medication for that  no it&#39;s just that it&#39;s just left over if that I&#39;m still of the stress from it I&#39;m still being treated for it but they don&#39;t really have any  imma try not to talk about it  I&#39;m in the past but it&#39;s treated  5 years ago  I was I was just very sad very depressed and so that&#39;s why things iety so I went to the doctor and they helped me that I did a psychotherapy  the app for the PTSD.  I don&#39;t know I guess so  it&#39;s just I&#39;m just kind of supportive because of the issues I have with my family it&#39;s it supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and  yeah it just gets me good feedback and helps me to make a decision that sort of thing  yeah I have nightmares about my family sometime  nah  I just try to sleep better I should I hide it before I go to sleep I sort of like meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help  I do have you all the time pretty much like I am a dog&#39;s make me happy and you know my life is really happy  I guess you know it&#39;s a nice person thoughtful a good friend  and happy fun person  I don&#39;t remember my forties now so I&#39;m pretty happy with myself I don&#39;t mind  you know I&#39;ve done a lot of work on myself and in therapy and stuff so I&#39;m pretty  I wouldn&#39;t really change a lot I&#39;m pretty happy with myself and I&#39;m about to sound conceited but I&#39;m I&#39;m pretty happy with myself now  oh that was that would be on my parents they&#39;re very abusive so I that I don&#39;t talk to them anymore so you know any times with them you know that they did Terrible Things today so I prefer not to talk about it  I like to see  well I just started reading a book I like to read cookbooks and I was just reading a book called on when French women cook and it&#39;s about a woman&#39;s relationship with different women in France in different parts of France in the end the cooking and so I&#39;m really enjoying that book  I usually you know I&#39;m get the grocery shopping done which I enjoy I really I really like doing the grocery shopping I go to a few places and then do a bit of cleaning and dime  just I relax  oh yeah I would I would say to have better self-esteem cuz I just have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so tonight I wish I&#39;d been happier in the past and you know taking me a long time to become unhappy because dinner no matter what it what I did whatever she meant I was I was never happy in the past I was I was always in a struggling with being depressed I didn&#39;t even know why and now and I realized because of whatever then set it that it was from my parents that I&#39;m a relationship and so my advice would be to not have a relationship that is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best place in abusive relationship  I&#39;m just the way I live my life the way I treat people I think you know  and I I believe it that your Deeds are very important that I try to treat people in a good way and I&#39;m proud of my work and I&#39;ve made that that&#39;ll give me a job that I like a lot of flexibility and I got to do what I like and  and you know people like my work and then also making my dogs really tired of them and  okay  thank you bye  that was funny  yeah  and then just do this
307 looking at you all right okay so now let&#39;s make sure the Xbox Kinect is picking you up with his move around dance  can&#39;t wait till this guy pops up is like a little green skeleton  okay when is the temperature let you know and you can just hit the door. So let me know.  thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend I don&#39;t judge I can I&#39;m a computer I&#39;m here to learn about people and would love to learn about you I&#39;ll ask a few questions to get it started and please feel  your answers  where are you from originally  Moscow  vitamins for life my family move to the US and then I moved down here eventually for college  how easy was it for you to get used to  long time to leave the money here for about a year since I graduated so there&#39;s been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though that&#39;s good  how do you like your living situation. I have two roommates and there&#39;s a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year in a couple months I think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality TV show for a while  how do you know the ones from college and the other one I found on Craigslist  how close are you to that varies depending on whether or not we&#39;re mad at each other so I just pretty cuz  right now I kind of distant  tell me more about that event the distance  okay, well we haven&#39;t seen each other around hung out in like 2 weeks cuz one of them got into like with car accident and so she&#39;s been distant since 10 and kind of locks herself up in her room  and the other one is always working late so we are scheduling has been off and the ones we made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it&#39;s kind of we&#39;re just waiting for someone I guess to make the first move  yeah that sucks it&#39;s okay  how are you at controlling your temper  it depends with whom  I&#39;m dealing with I guess I would say it was them people I guess is my family&#39;s not very good my boyfriend is not very good but with other people that I might not know so well then I&#39;m able to control little bit more but I&#39;ll do a little more passive aggressive rather than my full on anger  Sonic songs  Houston has been a positive influence in your life  she&#39;s probably been she&#39;s been we&#39;ve been best friends for High School freshman year of high school when we first mom  give me an example of that  as of what  how do you know that my friend to call we met in French class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kind of surgeon homework together and we had a lot of cloud the same classes together and so you can send Hangouts and then we just became closer and stay really close since then  what are some things you like to do for fun at going out with friends and the bar is going dancing biking hiking staying active then the movies playing at Cedar Restaurant stop tography  was hanging out with friends I guess whatever okay  how close are you to your family and various like I&#39;m really close to them when it comes to things of a like schoolwork those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things I don&#39;t really discuss that with them  Vegas superficially Club  but I rely on them a lot so what by guess  what are some things that make you really mad  I guess it depends who it is again I guess people who are in considerate and thoughtful flaky ignorant and  yeah and get those kinds of people and then people just and it&#39;s a lot of things that people react to different situations can make me angry I guess  when was the last time you argue with someone and what was it about my boyfriend and we argued because he&#39;s trying to be healthy and workout and save money and so so finding that when he doesn&#39;t see the orders pizza in so he&#39;s not saving money and he&#39;s not very healthy and so I got frustrated with him cuz I&#39;m constantly trying to push him to be healthy and that each time he was going to do it when you do it then he doesn&#39;t phase consulate breaking promises that&#39;s another thing that makes me angry people who don&#39;t follow through  yeah  do you feel that way often  about other people about myself or angry  whatever comes to your mind  angry I am so glad that now I don&#39;t feel angry often  okay  what&#39;s your dream job  that is a tough one how about getting paid to leave me now that&#39;s kind of what I&#39;m going to figure out right now cuz I quit my full-time job because I hated it as opposed to sitting in an office all day which I thought was extremely boring so now I work in a restaurant job and I&#39;m too old for a second job to support myself my dream job  I don&#39;t know what it would be but I know it involves people and I&#39;d love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment turns band and yet there&#39;s something I realized I like to see  the result from all my hard work cuz I majored in sociology and as much as I love that major it&#39;s you realize it&#39;s a whole lot of theorizing in arguing but with no real solution such as like as a and that&#39;s all you have is just being theoretical element that you can&#39;t do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or no people amazing artistic I love photography I love cooking baking and particularly so I know something  and that  Mom I guess okay  you travel a lot I used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we&#39;ve gone to 578 different countries I&#39;ve lived in three or four different countries I haven&#39;t traveled a lot lately just because I have no money and jobs kind of tie you down but I would love to have that is my dream job would be a photographer for National Geographic that would be awesome or a food photographer that traveled but anyways you enjoy about traveling  in the new places near faces and experiences I get Restless very easily it says nice of conflict be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine I hate the routine and Monday mass of everyday life is so it&#39;s nice to  does things.  I want to hear about one of your trips  okay  tennis tank mermaid trips  I have begun talking about I don&#39;t know what&#39;s funny even though I&#39;ve been to lots of different country is one of my most memorable memorable trips as one of the trips I took with my family is a three-week road trip with my family this five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon but it was really fun and even though I&#39;ve traveled so many places I realize that there&#39;s like such a beauty and the American landscape and so we were all around this house last in the Grand Canyon to Zion to the Grand Tetons to Yellowstone and it&#39;s absolutely amazing to sing about natural beauty is so and it&#39;s a grizzly bear black bear the Bison sounds really cool natural wonders also really miss me cuz those things aren&#39;t men made as as pretentious as it sounds after while you&#39;re kind of gets old but it&#39;s like and I guess the same way  white old white man building great buildings in artwork and yeah I see what you mean  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  I want  pretty easy as long as I  get supply I sleep so easy  what are you like when you don&#39;t sleep well grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don&#39;t say much I just kind of offer in my own world you feel that way often anymore I usually get enough sleep and I&#39;ve been working out more so it&#39;s not too bad that&#39;s good  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  I haven&#39;t just been one negative but I have to do it by circumstances kind of like spend about almost 5 months since I quit my full-time job haven&#39;t found anything else boyfriend interested in so  Esmeralda&#39;s like what am I doing that I did that kind of thing  can be talked about a good job these days it is higher than market and looks like I&#39;m very picky because I don&#39;t want to just sit in a little my own Cuba fault if I quit my job exactly for that reason why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that I quit my other job so it looks like I have to make it worthwhile that I quit my last job to get a better job as a kind of like stuck in this section of like living paycheck-to-paycheck barely making it just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it&#39;s like when did I give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world and spitting and we&#39;ll keep a cold I don&#39;t know when does that same situation after college so but I guess it&#39;s tough cuz a lot of my friends so they went to a pretty good school and you not have a friend his teaching English in Afghanistan  Teach for America and their friends in Hartford at schools like Harvard Matthew not getting her master&#39;s that&#39;s kind of like  got that comparison and then here I am with you in a little restaurant job so  do you feel down  I do sometimes yes but I&#39;m going to Hawaii next week so right now I&#39;m fine yes but yeah usually it&#39;s been kind of like down because I&#39;m just trying to find like what I&#39;m supposed to do you not like what I want to do next and my money situations are just very stressful as a school loan to pay off Insurance rent car loans like ants the groceries but I can&#39;t even afford groceries it&#39;s just hard to live this way specially after we paid so much money for amazing cause education so frustrating but there&#39;s a lot of people the same situation  turn down  have you been diagnosed with depression I don&#39;t think so but I mean I think everyone goes through depression here now so I don&#39;t know if you can but not like medically diagnose I&#39;m not on meds okay have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD  okay  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  oh that&#39;s to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail cuz I&#39;m one of those people from not going to be the best at something and I&#39;m not going to try except the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but I didn&#39;t get them told my high school self that don&#39;t try lots of things even if it means I&#39;m not going to be the best at it about 10 years ago made me like 12 so  I used to do a lot of things but I used to ask and it got to continue doing that I used to write a lot when I was younger I used to write miniature like little sorry sorry sorry it&#39;s for my parents all the time and I kind of stopped doing those things cuz it&#39;s like I&#39;m not good at it so I&#39;m not going to do it I just continue doing those things and tried sneaking out of classes and I&#39;m no different sports soccer growing up I don&#39;t know just expand my sophomore rather than likely I&#39;m good at and just stay with it but never really try harder cuz like I said I was going to say that one that was like once I&#39;m good I just stay for good and I&#39;ll try that go about that that monster Newsom  yeah  what do you do to relax  all right now it&#39;s super lame but I watch TV but I used to read of mice to read on my off-time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake bananas like since I&#39;m on my feet all day and like consol interacting with people I just kind of want to unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and be like I&#39;m done  which one of your most memorable experience  the top question  I&#39;m probably the day I got accepted into Pomona College it was a freshman at Wellesley College courses that woman called back and I hated it from Mike II from like the first week I just knew that I chose the wrong College not like miserable for the entire year and I only apply to one school of the transfer Pomona College by steps at in Clermont and  anime how can I get in and I also because there&#39;s like a 4% acceptance rate and if I go to the chances like this is ridiculous I don&#39;t think we can get in and I&#39;ll let you know the thought of going back to sleep but then I got an email from one of the admissions counselors that I had met when I was visiting Pomona and he&#39;s like I talk to you I just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about Pomona hope all is well and I was like why are you telling me the day we find out if we got you next that&#39;s it or not unless I got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later I got the email that I was accepted into Pomona and I was like my best day of my life so happy cuz I want ya and I text my mom and my little brother  hair pierce my dad&#39;s I was like let&#39;s start this whole thing over  how do your best friend describe you  The Voice  fine  maybe Moody you never know what you&#39;re going to get sometimes  probably  definitely friendly like a positive person  but sometimes maybe a little bit  aggressive  the most practicing positive things I mean she&#39;s my best friend so okay  when is the last time you felt really happy  really happy  oh and I was in Mexico over winter in San Clemente and that was really fun and it just like when sailing and walked on the missions at the beach that was really fun  don&#39;t forget time to greet the situation at school  okay I think I&#39;ve asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  goodbye  I didn&#39;t know you were super good thing  set the recording down in a we just have a quick food survey and then I can tell you a little bit more about what
617 wow  okay  I broke it  not so good  okay  all right questions and then when she&#39;s done she should say goodbye and you can press this button  okay  okay  should be how good  yes  I&#39;m doing pretty good  originally I was born in Denver Colorado  I like the beach sunshine  pretty girls  the ocean  other things  smog  excess amount of people in traffic that can be dealt with  I would like to travel more  seeing new things and and learning perhaps if you culture or something  oh okay I when I was younger I went to Europe and just did the backpacking thing  backpack around Europe for a little while and it was it was real fun  I&#39;m probably just being in the military with some friends and stuff like that  why have a degree in film and I&#39;m finishing a degree in or for business as well  now I look for work I&#39;m trying to do some sort of entrepreneurial effort now as I finish my business degree  it&#39;d probably be to own my own company that&#39;s kind of why I want some sort of entrepreneurial effort to push push for with some sort of interesting product or service that I&#39;d be working in  I would say middle of the road a little bit shy and at times can be takes a while to warm up  are you cautious to meet someone new and then from there  I kind of see where to go from there I guess  my family they still live in Colorado their interesting people and good as well as I talk to him  pray couple times a week they&#39;re good people I have one brother and he has a couple of kids and that he&#39;s married as well  that&#39;s a good question lately I&#39;ve been trying to get a daily amount of exercise like jogging or riding a bike and recently got a bike  something like that on a daily  effort  for the most part pretty good I try to if I have an outburst or if I&#39;m being irritable I try to stay away from people who didn&#39;t like to go off on people they didn&#39;t do anything wrong  Edward change the topic in my mind I guess  what gets me in trouble would be more I avoid things and it kind of builds up and becomes worse  and that kind of gets the trouble and  basically just in a relationship with a girlfriend  to be honest with that it remember exactly what it was about it&#39;s just probably in one of us is being irritable and me and  going from there or it&#39;s probably a lot to do with the money as well I don&#39;t have the best financial security at this point  that&#39;s a good question  oh my I guess I I do Harbor a little bit of guilt from the military as far as getting out and people are still in I suppose I know that&#39;s it&#39;s not for me anymore  only thing well I I used to work at for a friend and I invested into his company  and the economy went down was a construction accessory company basically and kind of movement down and we lost most of our money like most of the folks around America and that pretty much  it was a good and bad thing is you got to look at it from a good good perspective but it definitely put it myself into talespin I financially and couldn&#39;t really do anything about it almost was homeless for a little while  but I I wish I wouldn&#39;t have invested into the company and just move forward and  perhaps going to school like I&#39;m going anyway  I have  I was 21  I wanted a change in life I wanted some more real-world experiences  answer my country and also the added benefits of going to school or nice I didn&#39;t have  much Financial capabilities at that time and I wanted to change to get out of my current situation and that was the best way out I thought  are you happy  yeah yeah I&#39;m very happy I join the military I appreciate it now more that I mount and understanding kind of what I supposed war was about it is definitely changing people and myself as well  yeah I did a tour both in Iraq and Afghanistan as well  see I thought at first it was very easy and then I came to understand he was very difficult  just because I was adjusting from military life and still having that in my head and not until now I realize that I probably just a few months ago  to Reno reintegrate myself a little bit better and choose civilian life which it&#39;s it&#39;s actually it&#39;s actually pretty difficult  no problem  movie think I when I got out of the military  versus I&#39;d I invested like I said into my friend&#39;s company and we started that little business we&#39;re doing well for the while working and then lost all of our money  and then I traveled for a while at a gender stand now is obviously some other issues but I traveled all over America good working and went to school in New York for a little while  lived in a few different states and came back to California where I&#39;m finishing school finally  living the dream  that&#39;s a good question I would say  well it didn&#39;t and instills you with with very good I think since of  sense of character and strength and you know I think there&#39;s a lot of good qualities that the military are military puts a new people but at the same time it puts a lot of bad qualities  as well because you need some sort of edge or something that you need on on am almost daily basis and if you don&#39;t get that then in a lot of guys do you know turn into drinking or drugs just cuz you can&#39;t get that same Edge  and that really that can really either hurt or benefit you  I&#39;ve been feeling okay I&#39;ve had a bit of a sinus issues lately but I&#39;ve been feeling okay  actually I have my my thoughts I used to really have scattered thoughts  and  I would say I&#39;m starting to get a little bit better Clarity which is good  taking a lot of different therapy and stuff like that and it it&#39;s actually helped  it&#39;s it&#39;s very as I can&#39;t really let the tough part for me is the schedule because that&#39;s if I&#39;m not tired you don&#39;t sleep you just lay there  it&#39;s Hit or Miss really some nights I can sleep pretty well some nights I have to wait till I&#39;m exhausted  and I don&#39;t like doing pills  pills are bad I didn&#39;t understand that but it&#39;s basically just can&#39;t sleep because either you&#39;re on my mind is always thinking about something or something I feel that I have to do but yet I&#39;m not doing anything that&#39;s not true trying to always do something or do you have some some troubling dreams at times but that doesn&#39;t really negate me from sleeping and wakes me up is what it does because it can&#39;t be that the dream that you remember versus the one that you don&#39;t  when I don&#39;t sleep well  perhaps your ability and anxiety definitely go up I I definitely get I have a tendency to get a lot of headaches  and not sleeping very well definitely puts that into the mix  I have  not that I know of no  I I don&#39;t know I try to feel happiness on a daily basis I guess what you could answer but I&#39;m not certain  I&#39;ll say my my dad&#39;s been a very positive influence  that&#39;s a good question charismatic her funguy pretty tough  a good worker  I&#39;d say I really enjoyed jogging  the other day on the beach  something that I am most proud of I would say I&#39;m actually an online Minister as well and I married my brother and his wife and that was a pretty proud experience  all good  she said goodbye  okay
472 okay  sure  I&#39;m well thank you  Southern California  the weather the mountains the ocean  traffic  air quality  no not a lot  time money  I studied art  studio art  it was just always a a talent and a desire I had from childhood  I am  making a good living through my art  it&#39;s challenging  well  I need it&#39;s about having the time  and finding a niche that appeals to others while being able to do work that stays true to my own vision  somewhere between  I read  I walk dogs  I spend time with my family  so it&#39;s very good I love my family very much and they love me very much we were very supportive of each other  I&#39;m pretty good most of the time I&#39;m not so great when I&#39;m dealing with a lot of rush hour traffic  but it&#39;s not out of control  I don&#39;t really remember I want to say it was probably my daughter and it was probably about something stupid little stupid thing  my daughter is 39  beautiful brilliant very talented very goal-driven my son is 27 he is more laid-back very sweet and he&#39;s  starting to  be a little more goal-driven a little less satisfied with just the Daily Grind  being a parent is some  very challenging in a wonderful way  I think the hardest thing is is fear and worry for your children today&#39;s world can be very  violent and scary and you fear for your children safety and well-being  I&#39;m sorry  oh gosh  Sprint at the close friendship you have with your children the  the love the support the joy of just everything little things that you share  oh  well I&#39;m I  talk to my children about anything and everything we have very open communication which in my parents generation I think children were more seen and not heard  well with my daughter my first child I was young and inexperienced not only in being a mother but naive in a lot of ways regarding life in general and I think probably most parents have regrets of situations they may have had their children when they were when they were young that weren&#39;t the best  sometimes I feel that I should have  Ben  more aware at a younger age  just just  decisions in situations that decision to make situations you find yourself and when you&#39;re younger out of being naive and and  I even though logically I know that it&#39;s something that couldn&#39;t be avoided at the time you know as you get older you hindsight is 20/20 is she could older you you look back and wish that you had have been more on top of your you&#39;re  your life when you were younger  oh gosh  I honestly can&#39;t think of anything  I don&#39;t know if that I would want I can take him in advance I don&#39;t know that I would want to erase it from my memory because  I feel that we learn from everything and that there&#39;s I don&#39;t want to lose the lesson that I&#39;m to learn from that experience  positive influence in my life my daughter my son my granddaughter  there&#39;s only enough an author Carlos Castaneda  just stopped my my family has been a positive influence because of their love and support and in Reading Carlos castaneda&#39;s works I find that he  has a brilliant mind and because I&#39;ve practice some of what he talks about in his books and experience them as being authentic  where is some people  you know question has validity I found it he has something very extraordinary to offer mankind  pretty easy fall asleep pretty quick  no not really just always looking for the next two  projekt202  get started on  no  no  yesterday yesterday was Mother&#39;s Day and my children gave me flowers and beautiful gifts and made me a wonderful brunch and we spent the day together and it was very very nice  oh  is it going  easy to be around  friendly happy  I would like to work on being more focused on on projects  gosh  probably when I was a kid you know kids can be  kids can be cruel to each other so nothing that  I still at this age  take personally or are you know hold a grudge for  sure everybody has regrets but you do the best you can do at the time and you learn and you move on  I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t answer that one  oh gosh  I read a great book the last couple days and I&#39;ve been working on a new painting that I&#39;m really pleased with this I like the way it&#39;s going  my kids  but the fact that my kids are are  wonderful human beings I feel very blessed  goodbye  well that was interesting  should I take these off
381 okay thanks  hi I&#39;m Ali thanks for coming in today  I was created to talk to people and it&#39;s safe  are you okay  yes  okay  from Santa Monica  other people mostly  all the people all suck  I know not a lot  I can&#39;t afford to travel as much as I&#39;d like to  I was an English major  I just like reading a lot at the time so it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study  no not anymore  I love my job you could only say it&#39;s virtually made for me what&#39;s your dream job  it&#39;s my dream job would be to manage a soccer club  always be pretty much impossible for me  I don&#39;t have any experience in that field  very shy  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  I play music  what I do when I&#39;m annoyed I don&#39;t know  I do what I&#39;m annoyed  I can&#39;t think of anything I don&#39;t know  I don&#39;t think I don&#39;t do anything specifically  I pretty good I would say very good I don&#39;t lose my temper very often  I was the last time I argued with someone  I can&#39;t remember  I don&#39;t have a lot of conflicts with people I can&#39;t remember the last time I argued with someone  well it see when I was  a little kid  I was outside my grandparents restaurant and there was a robbery and I saw it I what I saw it when when the robbers were leaving  that maybe I would want to erase it from my memory if I could  well I didn&#39;t know what was happening in that moment so I didn&#39;t feel so bad at the time but I felt bad afterward because then  you&#39;re my mother was upset by my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was it was disturbing to see her you know really disturb that way but at the time it actually happened I wasn&#39;t really upset was more the aftermath of it  consideration that  I don&#39;t know  all I can think about this probably a million situations that I would have I would say I would have handled differently I can&#39;t think of one in particular  Maybe  I think that when I was a kid  well I think that when I was at sea  well I have okay have a good one  I didn&#39;t marry the girl that I think that I should have married so that&#39;s a big one for me  yeah well we were together for about 4 years  and I think I just took her for granted when I just didn&#39;t commit  and them  that was a long time ago and now that it&#39;s been so many years I realized well I don&#39;t know they fight the realization but I think now that  that yes she should have been my wife that we were meant for each other are made for each other  but because my selfishness and because I just  I have this fear of commitment at the time I just felt like I didn&#39;t  they didn&#39;t do what I should have done with with a smart thing would have been  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  well the last thing I can think of that I would say I feel guilty about was  now I feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships I&#39;m not I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m as good of a friend as I could be but then at the same time I don&#39;t really know exactly what the  how I could be a better friend I just feel a little guilty that I&#39;m not that I can&#39;t help people anyone who has a problem I can&#39;t I never feel like I can help anyone  who I know who has a problem so  how that happens every day I guess if that happens with everyone who I know and everyone  all of my relatives and all of my friends I don&#39;t feel like I can really give them anything or help them in their lives  tell me about your relationship with your  well there  it&#39;s very distant it&#39;s it&#39;s just it&#39;s very cordial and it&#39;s very  I don&#39;t know what the word is it&#39;s hot it&#39;s kept it a very surface-level I don&#39;t think that they know I don&#39;t think that my family really knows me very well at all  and I don&#39;t know them very well either not nothing to hide in a true sense  so  yeah it&#39;s  I think a lot of families are that way but it is it does bother me that mine is that way  how easy is it for you to get a good night&#39;s sleep so it&#39;s very easy I sleep a lot and I  yeah I have no problem sleeping at all  no not really I would say  the way I&#39;m now it&#39;s the way I think I&#39;ve been my whole life so  you didn&#39;t when I was a little kid I slept a lot also and no I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve changed much  I&#39;m pretty down but like I said  in a way I could tell you how I&#39;m feeling really down but then again I&#39;ve always been this way so it&#39;s hard to say that it&#39;s down when it&#39;s consistently that way  yes  I would long time ago I was about 10 years old  around there about  I was just missing a lot of school I didn&#39;t want to go to school so we eventually they sent me to  to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and  I want from there  you still go to therapy now no I haven&#39;t gone to therapy since I was a teenager  why did you stop  well I didn&#39;t feel it was helping me at all so one day I just  decided I didn&#39;t want to go anymore  affected you  well like I said it I didn&#39;t feel that it helped me  so I guess it&#39;s not enough that it affected me much  no I wouldn&#39;t say disturbing no  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  well I feel pretty happy whenever I see my nephew  and I have a  my best friend&#39;s children are I feel like their mind my nephew and my niece and I&#39;m pretty happy when I&#39;m around them  that&#39;s great  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  my ideal weekend would be  I would probably be traveling I would  really enjoyed getting out of the city every weekend  it going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city  I just seen the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go I really do think people are different when you go to different places and  how they interact with you and how they see the world different food  and I also like historical places I mean to history and I and I enjoy this visiting anywhere that has some sort of  historical significance  awesome  I haven&#39;t taken a trip in a long time  the last trip I really took was I went to France a few years ago for a wedding  and I had a really good time there I had always wanted to go to Paris and so I got to go to Paris and then I went to a little town  what&#39;s a few hours away from Paris where the actual wedding was  I knew it was really fun I think that the church where the wedding was was like a thousand years old so  that was a really cool trip  I got to know I don&#39;t have it I don&#39;t know what&#39;s what would would be considered memorable  a memorable experience  probably the most memorable experience I guess which is be  nothing in particular but but living with the girl who I just who I told you earlier that I think now that we should have gotten married  that&#39;s something that stays in my memory that&#39;s why I&#39;m saying it&#39;s memorable because  it&#39;s it&#39;s still with me in the  it&#39;s something that I don&#39;t think you know what I know I&#39;ll never forget but it&#39;s not any particular day or any particular moment  a lot  check it be healthier  for one thing and more energetic  and the more friendly I think I am pretty friendly  but more more outgoing more more more social  those two things mainly I guess that I would like to be more and more social more enthusiastic and more and healthier  that&#39;s a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me I think  I think he would say that I am  a very cheesy but probably say that I&#39;m a very spiritual person  and that I&#39;m very giving I think I&#39;m a lot more selfish than people think I am but people think that I&#39;m not selfish  and probably he would say there in Creative also  put my advice to to myself I don&#39;t understand the question  is there anything you regret  yeah but we already talked about it  no I can&#39;t. I don&#39;t think I really believed in and being proud or in the end Pride  I don&#39;t think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but I can&#39;t really think of  any accomplishments  anyway even if I did have something to be proud of. I can&#39;t think of any any sort of accomplishment I&#39;ve had  something I did recently that I really enjoyed  well I signed karaoke with a couple of friends of mine  I don&#39;t usually do that but  yeah that was a lot of fun a few days ago  thank you  I was more difficult than I thought it was going to be just kind of had me stumped a lot and a lot of the time and I was  I think I got better after a little while and I was  at first I thought I was going to get mad because I&#39;m not saying anything and I don&#39;t know how to answer and
691 where are the cameras I see that one  let&#39;s do it  and please  I&#39;m good.  My little tired  where you from  born in LA Live Griffin Carson so California  you know  I&#39;m sick of losing my interest in California with more and more everyday so I guess the weather  if the congestion and all the people that people out here kind of rude now  I&#39;m sure  you travel a lot  not lately no  no money that&#39;s a big part of it and that there&#39;s no money no time  what happened  everything I was went to college for some Human Services did some solartech installation studies than high school just general study  nothing I&#39;m unemployed so I stayed  to own and run my own medical marijuana dispensary  kind of shy  not much  it&#39;s okay you know I don&#39;t talk to him much I see him every now and again you know I don&#39;t see my kids too much but now it is what it is  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver  listen to music play some chess just sit back kind of just relax and let my mind wander  pretty bad at that I&#39;m working on it though  when was the  what&#39;s today Thursday so Monday Tuesday it was about somebody trying to tell me how I felt  tell me about  all right  damn good one  losing my job and not getting my daughter her birthday present on the day of supposed to be there  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had  shit hard to say that I&#39;d rather make leaving my son leaving my son&#39;s mother and my son wasn&#39;t an easy decision but it was probably for the best because we weren&#39;t getting along that much and I wanted to grow up in that type of environment where was always arguing  so there  tell me about Nevada  the shit that happened to me when I was a kid when I&#39;m with my family members I wish I could just forget about all that and have it not happen  yeah  have you ever  yes  United States Navy  how old were you when you done  19 years old  yeah 19  because when I got out of high school that wasn&#39;t doing anything I wanted my kids to have something to look up to and it was a promise that me and my buddy made to each other we were going to go in the service together but he died so I went just to keep the promise you know that&#39;s it  are you happy  yes or no  real yes or no  no  kind of difficult it&#39;s kind of hard making add adjustment from being able to tell people what to do and have them do it and then come out and you can&#39;t get a job and you don&#39;t say if you were telling you what to do you know the structure was different so a little difficult  that&#39;s okay you didn&#39;t do it  I started working at a power plant Mill doing some painting and I&#39;ve had a bunch of different job since then  so I did a few jobs  work work work  be worked at the airport California rather so you know bunch of different things  made me a harder person I don&#39;t have as much compassion and empathy for people  so you know it kind of shows you how people can really be  so yeah that&#39;s how change me  okay  how do you get feeling lately  anxious little upset from time to time  different like I&#39;m changing I just don&#39;t know how  will strange little weird feeling  yeah I don&#39;t want to I don&#39;t want to kill people like I used to I&#39;m a little bit more open with people I&#39;m quicker to a talk to him and would not so yeah my big my behavior has changed my attitude  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I don&#39;t know it&#39;s almost impossible  I&#39;m working off of maybe two maybe three hours of sleep right now  so yeah It Don&#39;t Come Easy  A little grumpy agitated all the time just so you know all I&#39;m thinking about is I want to get to sleep in my how come I can&#39;t sleep what&#39;s keeping me from doing it  so yeah I&#39;m easily agitated  have you ever  yep  yes yes I have depression PTSD anxiety  beginning of the year like January February sometime this year  like I said everybody I saw I want to kill or do some kind of bodily harm to him real short fuse I was mad at everything for nothing you know I don&#39;t sleep  I&#39;m always I hate crowds I don&#39;t like going into a confined spaces  so you know strange places I never been before it&#39;s a lot of people I don&#39;t like going to  so yeah I don&#39;t like people getting too close to me  you know that&#39;s a good read that&#39;s a good answer I mean good question I don&#39;t know it just crowns and strange people come in and closer to me and everything else I don&#39;t know what that might be it. Just  what it is but I&#39;m always wondering what the next person is going to do when they get that close to me like especially you think in a crowded room where you can&#39;t move around as much and you know I&#39;m always watching the whole everything trying to see who&#39;s going to do what and when  usually I try and get away from the crowd you know that&#39;s how I cope with them that I usually just trying to get away from the crowd not focus so much on it but it ain&#39;t hard specially if you got to be there but yeah I just kind of stay to myself and watch everything moving  okay  A friend of mine who I used to serve in the Navy with he told me  I should go  I should go and actually check out what&#39;s going on with my back but when I got in there I start talking to the first place I went was the mental health ward and told him what was going on with me, attitudes in my harmful thoughts to other people and that&#39;s what got me here but I got to say a friend of mine suggested that I go  yeah yes I do well my last therapy session was about a week or two ago but I&#39;m getting scheduled to go back  into therapy  yeah yeah yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s slow me down you know I&#39;m not so quick to want to hurt nobody no more I&#39;m not so while still defensive but  I don&#39;t look at it is I want to go and you&#39;ll saying  put do physical harm the young saying certain people just for being around  three more about what we want to hurt people  it&#39;s a weird feeling I don&#39;t know how to describe it it&#39;s kind of like describing the taste of milk to somebody it&#39;s just anybody I&#39;ll be walking in the hallway and a minute I&#39;m looking at them I&#39;m figuring  what kind of if I had to encounter that person how would I physically disabled them you know do you know the saying don&#39;t show come out do I just strike him in the throat poker I don&#39;t say break a leg or arm or something you&#39;ll just how can I incapacitate this person  it&#39;s a trip I&#39;m telling you the alternative just had a thought all the time with a complete stranger who really doesn&#39;t pose a threat to you is true  so  I&#39;m a little more tolerant I don&#39;t fly off the handle as much as I used to you know stuff that used to piss me off like you don&#39;t say little things I don&#39;t really get too upset about a may have sent me but  my reactions of different I don&#39;t like I said I don&#39;t explode cuz everything I mean the smallest thing with send me mail saying over the top but not so much no more you know it&#39;s kind of breathing take it in stride or try to you know  so yeah it&#39;s just it&#39;s working it helps  oh man really happy  oh my God  may all that has been some years it&#39;s been some years I can&#39;t even really put a finger on what I actually felt really happy  so you know cuz it&#39;s always been I might have moments where you don&#39;t say everything&#39;s cool and it&#39;s a good day or whatever but  I&#39;m still throughout the day there&#39;s they&#39;ll still Bostwick creep in and you know I&#39;m saying I&#39;m looking at people this that another thing I&#39;m saying this way and nut so yeah it&#39;s been awful long time since I was just genuinely really happy  great  is it all right if you say so  who&#39;s the real life  somebody&#39;s been a positive influence in my life my parents you although we have a problems you know I look up to them they&#39;ve been through with each other for umpteen years and a positive influence to me I mean outside of that there&#39;s a old girlfriend of mine named it don&#39;t matter who what name is old girlfriend of mine she&#39;s  kind of show me how to take life as it comes and you&#39;ll not everything&#39;s a battle because she&#39;s going through stuff that I&#39;ll never have to go through you know saying she&#39;s terminally ill but yet she still has a smile on her face and you know just keeps it going so I got to take a  a page out of her book with that one you know everything&#39;s not always all bet  how would you describe me that&#39;s a good question I really cool you know funny  you know but real honest you know and loyal you know crazy are crazy cool loyal fun and you know just  all around pretty decent person because he told me that not too long ago you like doing ain&#39;t nothing wrong with you man you all right you know you just you human so don&#39;t trip  but yeah that&#39;s my boy  but I really enjoyed  damn what was it cuz we just did it not too long ago  you know we  had a little cookout for some kids at The Villages where we stay at and I did the cooking for him you know it was for us but I got to cook for them and you know they was happy and we got to work in the garden a couple of days after that or the week after that is something so I kind of duck that real cool Yule saying watching a little kids run around happy you insane still innocent not knowing what life is really about the old saying Thanking us for  the shit we went through so hopefully they don&#39;t have to go through it but I had a ball with that a lot of kids  what are you most proud of  my children my kids mother my son my daughter&#39;s I&#39;m proud of them  because they&#39;re  did not like me my children are smart there like outstandingly smart you know  I started out that way but then I got  into wanting to be a cool kid in school start drinking and running around skipping school and all that but now my kids they don&#39;t do none of that and I&#39;m so grateful and proud that you don&#39;t think they actually make it somewhere in life my daughters have shipped my daughter in the Africa and other places places I was in the service and then go to she went because she was in school you know my son he&#39;s a he&#39;s a good kid you don&#39;t need a lot more like me than he actually knows he is but he&#39;s doing  so many things that I want to do when I was a kid but I

419 I&#39;m going to bring this doorbell over here  thank you  are you okay with this yes  I&#39;m good thank you  I was born in Mexico City  yes  I&#39;m about 34 years ago  yeah  I tried to go back once a year but I haven&#39;t been in about 3 years  I haven&#39;t had the time and I&#39;ve traveled other places but I&#39;m planning on going back probably next year  okay  how does it compare to LA  well I can&#39;t ever see myself moving back to Mexico City it&#39;s a huge huge City and I like La more there&#39;s more opportunities and I just feel at home here  my family moved here like I said I was very young and my parents moved to California to work and then we just stayed here  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer I love traveling I have not traveled as much as I would like to but I do love to travel  just seeing these things meeting people from other countries to stop feeling relaxed and having no worries because you&#39;re on vacation I just love being in other places  the last trip I took was a 7-Day cruise and it went to St Thomas Barbados St Lucia Dean Martin and it was amazing I would love to do that trip again  I think going to Mexico the last time I was there I went to the pyramids still see what&#39;s going on and I had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see the pyramids and I can&#39;t even imagine how they were able to build such great structures  I consider myself more sigh  in social situations I kind of feel uncomfortable I&#39;m not one to just go up to people and start conversations if people come up to me of course I&#39;ll talk to them but I feel slightly awkward just kind of out of place at a party  I actually studied history  I&#39;ve always been interested in history and I just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course US history so I&#39;m very interested history  I&#39;m actually working in the education field  what&#39;s your dream job  my dream job would actually be traveling around the world and having a show on like the Travel Channel that would be my dream job because I would get paid to travel and it&#39;s something I enjoy to do doing so I would love to do that as a job  I love reading and I love taking baths so to relax I like to take a bath and I read while I&#39;m in the bath and I also like going to the gym that helps me deal with stress and it actually relaxes me even though I&#39;m exercising  I used to be not very good at controlling it when I was a kid I would get mad very easily and sometimes as an adult I still get angry easily but I&#39;ve gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts things like that  the last time I argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was my best friend and she actually she has kids lie down and for some reason she thought or thinks that I think I&#39;m a better person than she is and because I went to school and she didn&#39;t and she&#39;s home with the kids and you know I&#39;m able to do more things I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever made her feel that I&#39;ve been I definitely know I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it  tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle different  well that&#39;s situation I wish I had handled differently because when she was talking to me she was very upset and I started off pretty, I&#39;m just trying to reason with her and let her know that I certainly didn&#39;t feel like I was better than her butt towards end of the conversation it just kind of turned into a yelling match between the two of us and I wish I had been able to just stay calm and maybe ask her to call me later when she calm down instead of just continuing the argument  I was angry at first but once we hung up I felt really bad about the situation I felt that maybe I could have just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly instead of yelling at her to  ever had  oh wow  that&#39;s a tough one I think  cuz I think one of the hardest decisions I&#39;ve had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of 7 years although I knew that it was the right thing to do I was kind of hanging on to the fact that we have been together for so many years and I kind of felt by ending the relationship I would have wasted those last 7 years of my life so is a pretty tough decision to make but I realize that it was the best decision for me at the time and I&#39;m actually glad I did because then I went on to meet my husband  thank you  about me bag or something that you wish you could erase from me  well about I would say maybe  15 years ago I was hanging out with a couple of friends at a club and they met some guys and they invited us back to their place and I really didn&#39;t want to go because I didn&#39;t know these people and I mean I knew their names and that&#39;s about it but my friends really wanted to go and I wasn&#39;t the one driving so I decided to just go along with them and back at their house one of the guys actually pulled me into a room and try I got scared I yelled he tried to choke me and I thought I was going to die right there right there and I was going to kill me but likely one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left so it could have been a worse situation but I still think about it and wish that I could erase it from my mind  it was  we have a pretty good relationship I am close to him I have a sister and a brother my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older and we got along pretty well my sister and I used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then and now we&#39;re actually closer I think than ever and I have a pretty good relationship with my parents my dad still treats me like I&#39;m a little kid sometimes way to annoys me but I think we have a pretty good solid relationship  how easy is it  I usually wake up a few times throughout the night so I think it&#39;s rare for me to sleep the whole night through ever and I do feel a little like tired in the morning when I wake up it&#39;s hard I&#39;m not a morning person definitely so yeah it&#39;s kind of hard to get a good night sleep  I don&#39;t know I have a hard time falling asleep and then sometimes I have bad dreams or I need to get up to use the restroom but yeah I don&#39;t remember the last time I actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once  emotionally good I&#39;m actually on vacation right now from work so that&#39;s really nice physically I feel good I haven&#39;t been to the gym in a while so that kind of makes me feel bad cuz I like working out but health-wise I&#39;m good  no  no  it was a lot this past weekend I actually went out of town with my husband we didn&#39;t go very far we went to Santa Barbara but we really enjoyed ourselves we went wine tasting and went to the beach and just had a really good time  how your best friend describe  she would probably describe me as a good caring person patient very shy to place a 2 that I have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors cuz I&#39;m always doing things for other people so yeah that&#39;s how I think she would describe me  I wish I was more outgoing I wish that  I what else definitely more outgoing so I could have more friends I don&#39;t have a large group of friends because I am very shy I also wish that I could have more patience than I do sometimes I&#39;m very sorry to Paisans and I wish I could  find a better job so I could do more traveling  yes I actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree and I really wish that I could have you know taking care of it a lot sooner than I did and I also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex-boyfriend  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  I would have told myself to stay focused on school that going out and hanging out and just you know going to parties was not as important as I thought it was and that my education should always come first  I&#39;m proud but after so many years of not being in school I was able to go to UCLA and get my degree yeah that would be my proudest achievement  okay  thank you  bye
366 so she&#39;s going to chat with you going to bring that doorbell back over here sounds good  hi I&#39;m Ali  creative  I&#39;m not a  you  and please feel free to tell me  are you okay with  okay  I&#39;m great and you  a Los Angeles California  I like the diversity I feel La by itself is a country there&#39;s so much to do so much to explore and there&#39;s nothing like it  traffic I would say traffic and it real estate prices are kind of crazy compared to the rest of the country  I have traveled I have traveled a bit I like to travel more though so I&#39;ve been to a few countries  like what I&#39;ve been to most of Europe at the continent I&#39;ve been to London I was born here but my family from Nigeria so I&#39;ve been to Nigeria a few times I&#39;ve been to Denmark Amsterdam I&#39;ve been to World sci-fi. Germany and I think that&#39;s it that&#39;s it yeah that&#39;s it  what do you enjoy about  just exploring exploring new places sing new things meeting new people a different culture it&#39;s definitely gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it and also going to countries that may not be as adult as the USA definitely definitely gives you a greater appreciation of you know what this country  okay well let&#39;s see London I accidentally actually when I first heard about going to London I really didn&#39;t care for it cuz I know much about it the only thing I remember is watching Mary Poppins and but when I went there I absolutely fell in love with it just  if I have the hustle and bustle of LA but at the same time you can go to very very slow pace we didn&#39;t do any driving we just went on the tube which is there are like the underground subway station which I absolutely fell in love with and just exploring different parts of the city we went to you know Big Ben Westminster Abbey they actually had when I went there the other premiere of the movie with us Slumdog Millionaire and also they had to Premier for seven seven pounds is a movie with Will Smith they did so Will Smith was over there and we were you know me and my friends are like I like screaming like we were like groupies just so you know just so you know your antics but yeah  yeah  business management and an option in Human Resources management what that means I have no idea  the question I&#39;ve always avoids want to go into business and I&#39;ve always want to study Finance but I didn&#39;t think I would learn too much about Finance from  College purse I think I&#39;ve learned more in the real world whatnot so that option was human resource in the morning fasting about you know relationships and people always like reading articles about that stuff so I went for that  well I still I still kind of use what I&#39;ve learned but I I work in Property Management so  anything to do with people I&#39;m fascinated about so yeah  I love my job  say it&#39;s virtually made for me  how to get one my dream job wow  I would say being a life coach  I&#39;ll tell ya I would say about my dream job because I love helping people become successes and I helped I love being a part of someone else&#39;s success even the regardless of how small it is I&#39;m will it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation I like I just like helping people have a better life so I think you know idea for Friday for free like all day yeah  more outgoing definitely more outgoing I&#39;m usually the life well it&#39;s weird cuz I&#39;m usually considered like the life of the party I&#39;m the one who is cracking jokes and making everybody laugh at the same time I can be very very quiet and to myself so  I turn on the fish tank screensaver I know it&#39;s not Hawaii  what do you do  to relax I usually listen to music  Asia listen to music to relax me or I pray  try to relax myself or listen to some really calm music so yeah  very good very very good I used to I want to say was a bad temper but I was known to  go off quot and quot not throwing chairs anything like that but  I&#39;m a very patient person  once that patient is gone and for you to do that you have to really really really really push my buttons for a long time and once it&#39;s done I I just go off  no no  the last time I argue with someone while having argue with me long time  boy  I argued with my  no I would see my I think my dad I argued with them about  we were disagreeing on some things about when we&#39;re going to supposed to go back to Nigeria  and he wasn&#39;t listening to it was kind of a group discussion myself in my my siblings and he was being very subjective he wasn&#39;t being open to other people suggest engine suggestions and concerns  so it started an argument  very  I would say angry per se but I felt very  come like I was losing control  like a mom to type while I like to be in control of my emotions in my thoughts and I feel  once that patience is gone and I start going to off it&#39;s kind of like this  yeah I&#39;m called a blur but I&#39;m very witty and quick with what I say so I&#39;ll instantly say something that you know  how to say hurtful but I&#39;m very direct and to-the-point make sure I get my point across  I have three brothers one one younger to older I am very close to my family and my mom&#39;s are my best friends  my brothers are great love them to death my father and he&#39;s more thought of it picture  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really I&#39;m not the guilty pipe I don&#39;t feel guilty I&#39;m not one to shy away from what I&#39;ve done and I definitely own up to add you I&#39;m not one to shy away from responsibility I don&#39;t think I ever feel guilty  Frank thing I do  yeah I don&#39;t think I feel good I usually don&#39;t feel guilty  pretty easy pretty easy at yeah I&#39;m pretty good at falling asleep except when I&#39;m excited while I&#39;m reading from check when I&#39;m going to focus on learning something like I&#39;ll read and read and read it when it&#39;s past my bedtime but now I&#39;m going to work on  waking up much earlier than when I am now and it&#39;s kind of a little bit of a struggle but I&#39;m getting to it so  I&#39;ve been feeling I&#39;ve been feeling fine you know I&#39;m generally a very very happy disposition and sell  no yeah deep depressing moods nothing like that whenever if I feel do feel like I&#39;m going I don&#39;t know allow myself to go to that place  have you been diagnosed with depression  thoughts  I would say  it&#39;s I want to say necessary changes by same or so behaviors learning how to  let go of past decisions may be that kind of how they they play their course in my life  I just said sometimes I kind of look back and say what if I did this what would have how would life be now now so that doesn&#39;t that&#39;s it  designing your  regrets no no there&#39;s anything I regret  Dennis 20 years ago  I would say don&#39;t be afraid of Who You Are  I&#39;m be authentic more imprinting with yourself  erased from my memory  that&#39;s a good one  restore my memory  I would say what I say oh my tell my dad that he should act like a father  maybe I should yeah there was a  that was actually one of the times I am by the time I went off with him mom basically I had decided not to go to a private not to go away for college  I want I decided to stay local so I can look after my little brother  and my senior year I was overloading with everything I had maybe like for AP classes I was working if I was working three jobs at the time and was also on track and field so needless to say I was and I&#39;m  I wasn&#39;t doing well in AP Calculus because I decide to go to a JC first and transfer also the save money for college to and when I told him you know the teacher called Sing us falling asleep in class because mind you after school I work an 8-hour shift cuz I was a retail manager at the time so I come home after that ship to do homework calculus let alone so he would get upset and I told him I spoke my accounts already told him that I don&#39;t need that class to go to the JC but that&#39;s okay I&#39;m going to continue with some just going to I can&#39;t drop out at that point in time so I&#39;m just going to let you know  yeah I&#39;ll discuss take the dfl whatever and he didn&#39;t he didn&#39;t like that cuz he is a teacher  and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanted to call my boss and it was it was just too much and I told him yeah sure my father should act like it but I was supposed more aggressive  one thing I do remember I do regret one thing  and that is I wish I continued with college throughout  like I I I burnt myself out I&#39;m out spreading myself too thin nails actually I was actually on track to graduate from college at Wednesday 19 starting college classes in high school starting sophomore year in high school but with that that stuff enough stuff for Dad and working I just kind of like stop going to school for a while just worked if I went back to finish so but maybe that&#39;s one small thing but that&#39;s something small down  yeah  I&#39;m very I&#39;m a very compassionate and understanding person  I like learning new things I&#39;m a very very happy person people come to me for advice I&#39;m very objective I&#39;ll tell you the good the bad the ugly  and yes those are my best qualities  man found a way to have fun in any situation I can make light of any situation like I&#39;m the kind of diapers I can break the tension in the room that sort of  that sort of a  personality trait  wish I was taller  beside my Heights  I wish  Maybe  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s that be more I want say be more in touch with my emotions I think I would say understanding people&#39;s how people feel about me in their shoes  I think that would be one thing because I&#39;m the type of person wear  people say that they love me or care about me and I&#39;m like okay great thank you I appreciate that I don&#39;t realize how much they do I think that&#39;s not realizing how much they care and love me that&#39;s one thing I would like to  get more of a grasp on  my best friend she described me as someone who&#39;s funny crazy objective boil  ambitious hard-working  mean why is Lake Joseph you&#39;re so mean  just I just I I I just like to I joke around all the time and so  we were right now at

659 now I&#39;m going to pull up over to human yoga to see what she looks like I&#39;m going to go ahead and start the camera recording up here hi Allie  I&#39;m not a therapist  and please feel  are you okay with this yes  okay  so how are you doing today pretty well how about you  where are you from originally  play like about ale  well feel that I don&#39;t live in LA I live in Long Beach I like that there&#39;s  activity going on lot and a lot more people but generally I&#39;m a small-town type of person  what are some things you don&#39;t really like a brother  crime  overcrowding cost of living  as much as I can  which one of your most memorable experiences  that&#39;s really hard to say I had a lot of good experiences in the military lot of good experiences in my marriage different traveling places camping raise children I was all good things  what you study  Human Services  all right now I am disabled and hopefully starting back to school in the fall  a dream job was to be a chemical dependency counselor  I just say it depends on the circumstances sometimes I can be quite withdrawn velvetizer iron would really outgoing I guess it just depends on this time  sometimes I&#39;m in really deep thought or have something going on internally so I don&#39;t really say a lot I got more observant at that time then I think there&#39;s something that needs to be said I&#39;m not I&#39;m not afraid of saying it  tell me about your relationship with your family  I have a really good relationship with my family we all speak on the weekly basis I come from a large family have a lot of brothers and sisters my mother and father still living so I talked to them my mother lives not too far away from your father lives in the back  I got two older brothers that I talk to on a regular basis and my younger sisters that I talked to lots of nieces and nephews  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  I listen to classical music  read something maybe watch a movie that&#39;s good that&#39;s a good Escape read something go to I&#39;m involved with Alcoholics Anonymous I might go to a meeting that that helps me the interact with others  how are you at controlling  I rarely have an outburst it imma call him person my demeanor sometimes tells people otherwise but I&#39;m really calm person that people say that I look mean but I&#39;m not  when was the last time you argue with someone  that&#39;s really hard to say it&#39;s probably  just a disagreement with how somebody was being treated and I&#39;m really that really bothers me when someone is being mistreated and I don&#39;t even really know that it really point it out but I know that&#39;s probably what it was about  the first thing that comes to mind is when my marriage broke up  I wish I would have just accepted it a lot sooner than I did and moved on with my life but it took what I had been I&#39;ve been married for over 20 years and I was hard for me to accept to accept the fact that my wife wanted a divorce and I tried to hang in a lot longer than just got myself used and abused so I wish I would have just grabbed that situation and moved on a lot faster  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  that&#39;s when my wife and I took our granddaughters and I promise to raise them and then see them through their upbringing that I didn&#39;t have the opportunity to do that by law that was my fault and I feel I feel guilty about that  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to make  white goes back to acceptance of accepting my the end of my marriage that was that was the hardest decision was so when I finally just decided that to stop fighting the the  what was going to happen it and move forward  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory  I wouldn&#39;t ask say that probably wouldn&#39;t want to erase anything from my memory because I have grown and learned from every experience I&#39;ve ever had in my life so I wouldn&#39;t say that I want to erase anything  that proved that load of thing that makes me who I am today  and I like me today  have you ever served in the military yes I have veteran of the United States Army  how old are you when you join the military was 19 years old  financially the idea of having a college money once I was very motivated to go to college having that money to to fund my college education was very  appetizing and also I felt like I needed a break from academics but I knew I wanted to start it up again at some point but that didn&#39;t happen you know life happened I got married and then another. I say I&#39;m still trying to complete a college education now at age 47 so  almost 30 years ago on by but I&#39;ll get it  yes it&#39;s the best of the best experience best thing I&#39;ve ever done for myself but joining the Army I still paying dividends it it&#39;s my living today&#39;s helps me pay my bills today my pension that I receive  taught me a lot I got to got to meet people from all over the country see places that I&#39;ve never seen before getting a lot of opportunities  did you ever see combat no I did not  how easy was it for you  it&#39;s a little of this a bit of a struggle you know when you serve in your car after you get used to being regimented and having a place to be every day and then all of a sudden you&#39;re free basically in and you don&#39;t don&#39;t have that that discipline in your life anymore so it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to to readjust  I think it took me a long time longer than I realized  see I was a security guard I worked in the bakery at a Safeway store  that I install carpet and floor coverings  for about 10 years or better  working retail that&#39;s a lot of different jobs  all right  how did serving in the military change you  gave me a lot of self-confidence I was never a very athletic inclined but that&#39;s the most physical activity that ever had I develop my body  develop my mind show that much metal 42. I had that I had got me over a lot of things show me a lot of strength about myself  that&#39;s great  how do you been feeling lately lately I&#39;ve been feeling pretty good  it&#39;s been going pretty well I&#39;ve been very a lot more active than I had been  I&#39;m searching for an apartment right now moving out of my lips are current living situation that&#39;s very exciting just been more active in my daily life  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately  I&#39;m just not on the same lines I&#39;m seem to be a little bit happier the depression isn&#39;t there it&#39;s so  overwhelmingly still have some bad days but not take my medication and then I go to my counseling and its everything seems to be working out pretty well  sorry to hear that  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep is very difficult I toss and turn I have night sweats probably having nightmares and I don&#39;t recall  I wake up several times  what are you like  actually I&#39;m not more overly energetic adrenaline takes over and Ida zip through my day with and then at the end of the day I&#39;m exhausted then that makes it hard to sleep again so it&#39;s just too  just continue with vicious cycle  so I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know what to do about it I do not talk to my doctors later want to put me on too much sleep medication and so I just try to get a good night&#39;s sleep and just take as much rest as I can try not to nap during the day hopefully having a better sleep during the night  yes  time it&#39;s been over 10 years cuz all probably longer than that I don&#39;t remember the exact date  anger  nightmares  restlessness  I don&#39;t recall everything that they say that cuz I have a lot of overlapping problems so  and anxiety  not that I&#39;m aware of  I really don&#39;t know what to say  I guess I have to get a  I talked about it  I feeling down after I talk to people I get out and I do things going to help somebody else get out of my get out of self and get service to others if I get out of self and it&#39;s quite helpful  that&#39;s good  what got you to seek help  well what brought me this would have gotten me to seek the help is that was an alcoholic and I was drinking and  and I wanted to quit drinking and then I had to discover the reasons that I was drinking and now you know I was drinking alcohol as a as self medication for different problems and I had to get away from the alcohol and other substances you know other drugs and once I did that I was able to  professionals who are more able to differentiate with the alcohol problems from the other problems and  prescribed the right medications prescribed the right then type the right type of treatment or group therapy individual therapy those things have been quite helpful  do you still go to therapy now yes I do  yes I do have group therapy 5 days a week and individual therapy once a week  do you feel therapy is useful very much so  I&#39;m able to take my  old heavy luggage and leave it somewhere not carry it around you know it&#39;s like a  it&#39;s like I had this big balloons over my head that still with  all might  negative thinking my negative  situations by negative thoughts everything and every time I&#39;m in therapy or I mean the AA meeting or see a meeting I get to empty that vallone out not carry to carry out such a burden to get leave that luggage that garbage somewhere else and I got to carry it around and have it be a burden on myself so I was quite helpful  can you tell me about that  and which may  I&#39;m just it&#39;s just an excellent way of  getting rid of bad feelings  Cher  Matt is depressed a lot more outgoing  I still have a lot with a long way to go  I don&#39;t my feelings of unworthiness are  limited they still are there but I do feel better about myself that I like myself better today than I did say 2 years ago  so there&#39;s there&#39;s hope  when was the last  I can&#39;t say it it&#39;s kind of fleeting  I don&#39;t know that I ever get it like a really super overjoyed  everything is always so  muffle for me I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever really just joy joy joy  my first

632 okay  okay  okay  that&#39;s pretty cool  I&#39;m going to start the recording okay  she said say  Okay okay so just wait for her to ask question just answer okay  okay  thank you  okay  yes I am  something good  I&#39;m originally from Orange County California  and now I live in Los Angeles  I went to college here so I enjoy the fact that a lot of my friends are still around so just ability to see them and be able to hang out with them is really good obviously the weather has been amazing all the time so those are a few things I like about la  right  obviously traffic  and I don&#39;t know I think traffic is the main reason and aside from that I don&#39;t have much to complain  all my used to for my old job but not anymore so I&#39;m pretty much based in La most of the time  I&#39;m just a bility to see other things and explore new things whether it be going to a new site seeing area or trying different kinds of food just the fact that I&#39;m in Conjuring something else or something you is something I enjoy about traveling  and obviously the people that I am with when I am going traveling cuz I rarely travel by myself so you know whether I travel with my boyfriend or friends the fact that I have companions that I enjoy spending time with you something I enjoy  sure I for the 4th of July past weekend or two weekends ago actually went to San Francisco to visit my boyfriend so we actually he was moving from LA to San Francisco so we drove up to the Bay Area saw his family and then stayed with my friend who recently moved into a new apartment in Oakland so we hung out with her spend the day in the city went to the ferry building went to the Fisherman&#39;s Wharf and hung out and went shopping so although you was kind of a Bittersweet goodbye cuz we are now I&#39;m now in LA and he&#39;s in San Francisco but it was a really fun trip  from the past trip or just in general  I studied mathematics and economics  I am actually I just quit my job last Friday I&#39;m taking some time off before I go back to graduate school  my dream job  let me think for a second I think I&#39;m really interested in social commerce and Retail so something that combines my interests and also gives me the ability to spend time with people I love my previous job I was working a lot so I was always constantly working and I didn&#39;t really get to see anyone or do anything on my own or as I have a hobby but I don&#39;t have a job that would give me the flexibility to pursue what I want to do outside of my professional life  outgoing  I don&#39;t know what I mean you people or when I just hang out with people in general I&#39;m not  I&#39;m not shy to speak about my feelings or you ask questions or engage in a conversation initiate a conversation so I don&#39;t consider myself shy  sure my family and I are pretty close there back in Orange County but I&#39;ve been living apart from them for about a ready for years but I still visit them almost every other weekend we go out to dinner and then I hang up my mom we have our shopping strips and spa days once in awhile so we get to bond so I think I have a pretty close relationship my family most importantly my mom she&#39;s like almost like my best friend  I work in the entertainment industry when I work at a YouTube Production Studio which we make content for YouTube vloggers or whatever you call it so I just kind of go on YouTube and look at my favorite YouTube Vlogs from people it&#39;s kind of like a mini reality show so I think it&#39;s pretty fun other than that I just kind of go through my old pictures to think about like fun times I&#39;ve had bruised Apple from my trip to Costa Rica last year at my boyfriend or my trip San Francisco with my friends or just kind of think about like  good times I&#39;ve had in the past or also I enjoy like exercising of being in nature so I would go for a hike in Santa Monica or something like that  I think I&#39;m pretty  good I&#39;ve never had a situation when I was out of control or now is  I was acting like I was in myself I think when I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve actually never had a situation when I was I wasn&#39;t able to control my temper I just kind of stay calm and think about the situation and think about how I&#39;m going to respond to it and try to respond to it wisely  let me think I I don&#39;t I can&#39;t really remember the last time I argue just saw on maybe when I argued in my old remain about our friendship kind of so we had a conversation about how both of us are kind of drifting apart from each other but it was more of a conversation than the argument so we were able to run both of us are kind of like getting heated up by the topic but we was just kind of cool down and talk about the situation and talk things through  oh yeah sure so I remember a few months ago a friend of mine visited from Washington DC and we enter a different friends house in Hollywood so when I was there there was this guy who kind of was very confrontational with me about what I do or what I want to do or my stands on certain topics for example was education and then and he started kind of saying like oh you know you&#39;re not secure about the Way You Are by blah blah so I kind of was I kind of got angry at them and I just told him  like you&#39;re not giving me a good first impression and you&#39;re what you&#39;re saying doesn&#39;t make sense and I kind of like was very argumentative with them I wish that I was more common was able to kind of  pro more on why he thought that way instead of attacking him verbally  guilty I&#39;m guilty about quitting my job too early I&#39;m going back to graduate school and the fall so I was actually supposed to stay a little later till end of July but hey I wanted to enjoy my time and just be unemployed for a little bit so I ended up quitting my job a little early which is a burden on my boss so that&#39;s something I feel guilty about  tell me about the hardest decision  sure I can talk about my recent graduate school preparation process I was deciding between Glee which is in the Bay Area and he witches in Boston  like I mentioned before my boyfriend lives in the Bay Area and then he probably would have a I can be together with him in the same area but I think once I got the acceptance letter I knew that I wanted to go there just right away so I had to decide between being on my boyfriend and being complacent and kind of comfortable in California vs venturing out into different city different state different people different environment and B&amp;B in Massachusetts and I ended up deciding with  although it&#39;s far away from my parents family friends boyfriend but I wanted to explore something else and being a different environment  I don&#39;t know if I have anything I want to completely erase from my memory may be my great grandma passed away when I was in the eighth grade I remember I was in a different room but my grandma passed away in a different room but had I stayed there with her I could have kind of see her passed away but I didn&#39;t get to do that cuz I was watching TV and some other room and just hanging out I wish I could erase it from my memory cuz it was kind of a traumatic event in my life  no I haven&#39;t  I&#39;ve never served in the military  I did not  I have never served  oh I wouldn&#39;t know because I didn&#39;t listen to military  no  I&#39;ve never served in the military  I didn&#39;t serve in the military  I didn&#39;t serve in the military  you know just I quit my job I had a good going away party I&#39;m getting ready for grad school a lot of exciting things ahead so I&#39;m excited and happy  not really I think I&#39;ve been a lot more positive than before  very easy  I&#39;m grumpy and I eat a lot more and I drink a lot of coffee  no  no I have not  2 months ago when I got my acceptance call from my dream School  I think first and foremost my mom she&#39;s always reminded me of who I am and  you know why I am on this Earth  and it sounds kind of philosophical but she&#39;s been my Foundation  they would say energetic kind of intense sometimes outgoing  yeah  I enjoyed  when I went hiking two days ago and  I want my friend Stephanie it was a two-hour hike it was a lot of fun and I always loved hiking so that was something I really enjoyed recently  nice  I&#39;m most proud of the fact that I was able to  Aquaman Aquaman at myself internal environment I actually came when I was I came here when I was in when I was 13 so the fact that I got to where I am in life despite not having not learning how to speak the language about 10 years ago that is something that I&#39;m very very proud of  goodbye  hello Cat takes off

I&#39;m very close to my parents not so closed with my brother and their family  it&#39;s deep I mean like  I tend to be judgmental and I think sometimes that the my niece and nephew should have been brought up in a different way and you know  and you know my my brother doesn&#39;t seem to think along the same lines and you know but we have disagreements and you know that&#39;s the reason  it is  no not at this time  what do I think of wife  can you can you repeat that one more time  can I still couldn&#39;t follow you  okay  no  no  oh yes  Wanted 2 years ago  I was feeling down and I was not interested in things that are that I would normally interested in  and you know I was sort of withdrawn and the it was I was not able to focus on my things so I thought maybe I should go see a doctor and I ended up doing that  no  how many died last appetite I was not sleeping well and  I had difficulty concentrating you know and focusing and I would not getting my assignments done on time these were some of the problems  I&#39;ve been feeling good  but  no I don&#39;t  I started doing yoga and you know I&#39;ve been doing that for about a year and that&#39;s and meditation and that&#39;s helped a lot  so it&#39;s just that you know when I was diagnosed with depression I thought I should be taking any medication for it and I was looking at it other ways to get over the problem and then I realized some of my friends we&#39;re doing meditation and  oh you know I ain&#39;t got into in Spider-Man  it&#39;s a little difficult but after I&#39;ve been able to sleep with in half an hour there are days when it takes almost 1/2 hours to go to sleep  are they what can you repeat that  oh no  I just been open  just switch off the light and Binoo keep tossing around then  try to focus on things that makes me feel good  and the snap  but three days ago  what am I proud of  I wasn&#39;t out I was among the top 2% in my MBA class and  and when I used to run my business I designed a product that was working really well  and I was happy that I was able to design something that was so useful for my business  my  I&#39;m thinking my friends would describe me as very friendly very easy to get along with  very focused very intelligent  and a good cook  Albert Einstein  of  summer summer summer full stories  you know he obviously didn&#39;t it involves lot of deep thinking and are the the first few times I write about him about his theories I had difficulty in really understanding that and that it over  I mean when when when there are things that I really try to understand and I am not able to  and you know they&#39;re out there all the type of people I admire  listen to other people  are its diverse and I like the the entertainment industry  and  I like a  the other fact that there are more women than men here  there are certain areas where Wendy&#39;s where only Spanish is spoken you know I would like for all people who come to America to be able to understand English and be able to speak in English  so that everybody can participate  in LA  me like I  some of the things the political leaders do really makes me mad sometimes I think they&#39;re wasting their wasting their time our time and other countries are advancing and you know what these guys don&#39;t get things done and you know I feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry  yeah I mean the first four years of Obama administration now I think it was wasted because if the  if Congress had acted together and got things done then you know  maybe we could have made it much more difficult for China to catch up with us and you know the fact that China is able to do things and get things done much faster and these people steal you know arguing  you know follow-up find fault with each other and not get things done. They don&#39;t seem to realize that you don&#39;t you know that clock keeps ticking you know they have to get things done  I mean like you know well  one thing that comes to my mind is well you know I made a lot of money while we know once in Los Angeles and you know I thought it happened during Christmas some 10 years ago  and that&#39;s that made me very happy  good music good food  I mean the party with friends that I like  hand  and  you know I also like cooking and I enjoy cooking with groups in groups do the things that really put me in a good mood  I&#39;m sorry clean  I listen to people  and I empathize try to solve their problems  and I&#39;m hoping they think I&#39;m it up my advisers and recommendations are worth their time  thank you so much to be nice by
436 that was big  yes  I&#39;m doing fine  Mexico  when I was young seven years song  I&#39;ve been there like that three or four times for vacation  well it&#39;s a less stressful I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I&#39;m on vacation but I feel more at peace over there than here  well my family moved down here for a better life that was my parents  just the weather and different things that you could do you could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains different variety of things to do  the traffic and some basically the traffic and that&#39;s one of the main things  nothing much I&#39;ve been to New York and Mexico only  I just seen you places and finding new locations you know something new  like for a trip over  I&#39;ve been to Mexico I&#39;ve been to the pyramids of I forgot to call in Mexico City and I like to know about finding a lot of my Asian culture since I&#39;m Mexican from Mayan Aztecs I like to see different things like that  well that&#39;s cool why did drop out but I came back and I&#39;m trying to get back into it right now trying to learn graphic designs  well I started liking you know to take pictures doing different things and I like you know going into business I like what the titles about  I want to have my own business either making web pages just be able to be free and don&#39;t be in relying on someone else just be able to have freedom for myself  how&#39;s it going  Spectre you know be around people like to get to know people and depending on the person how I feel around them  I&#39;d like to hear music or you know it was a different thing that case boards or two different things just to unwind  well I&#39;m getting better at it you know  Hyatt connect  I was like  2 days ago I was something about that I needed to pay bills on something that I did not have taken care of but the person he&#39;s like more picky about it and I was more know how gross are you know that they want everything right there and then  I have a handle you know I have everything there and they just bugging sometimes they don&#39;t give you the space that you need to erase all something  I felt like I was overwhelmed already had it resolved I just was waiting for a check you know it&#39;s not on my control but I already had made the paper proper arrangements and she&#39;s bugging me about it it&#39;s like  you&#39;re making an argument and storm in the glass of water  the different need thirst couple of them but not so recently because I&#39;ve been more trying to get my life together but since I made before in the past I dropping out of school and do another different thanks  guilting not that much because  not really not that I can think right up top of my head  the hardest decision  I was just on top of my head right now  the band  the only things that I remember is when I black out or different things like that that I remember  nothing like a particular only with my brothers died and different things like that  how my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more to trouble  and it&#39;s just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much get into it  don&#39;t understand it. You know I like to be with my family and you know I like to go over there to Mexico to I have a half-sister and my grandpa died he was older Mexico so I do I like to have a good relationship with my family  my mom and dad they always work hard they always done what they have to do to pay the bills that&#39;s why sometimes I be like you no running around trying to get everything done but done correctly not trying to take the easy way out  it&#39;s a little hard because they&#39;re especially here in Los Angeles there&#39;s a lot of different things that you can get into that&#39;s not that positive and it&#39;s hard to stay focused on you know the correct stuff  Well normally I just knock out it&#39;s not that hard it&#39;s like to take me like half an hour or 15 minutes but sometimes I can even wake up even with the alarm they have to wake me up in know my grass wake me up in with the alarm going on it&#39;s like so hard Cena I just knock out  I do get a little either I&#39;m angry or I don&#39;t feel good and then I&#39;ll feel bad energy but I still have to know I know I have to do something so I still go through with it  I&#39;ve been swept in the feeling good do you know then that little restless but not that much I have to do stuff so I guess you know for myself to do it no matter how I feel  nothing out of the ordinary  no  the last time iPhone happy that was following the weekend that I would see not going out with a cloud have some fun and they know I was drinking and just relaxing I want winding down  ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home just relax when nothing else you know just be able to relax and unwind with her you know you were going out somewhere tonight place we&#39;re staying at home that without getting any calls or in the interruption might just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything just be what are doing the other different things  like an outgoing guy in a very social but at the same time I&#39;m reserved depending how I feel with people  at the cross her feel comfortable with them  well I&#39;m changing a lot of my temper and different things drinking things on changing the different things I could get more different things done  there&#39;s several but mostly is when I&#39;m coming from Mexico that they wanted the meaner you even down there I feel like silly because I went to a store I was regularly dressed and I was the time I wanted to buy something and then they said that that I wasn&#39;t belong there and I ended soon as they saw my credit card they kind of change perspective because I saw the Wells Fargo logo they know it&#39;s American but they thought it was let you know  what is told me it&#39;s all ridiculous to me because you go to a place you know you have the money ask for something you can ask for something because you have it and not just the way to kill the time just because they saw a logo of a card that&#39;s how that you know it was ridiculous for me  no  basically to stay more focused on different things that stay in school and then I don&#39;t go to not try to control my temper and do different things cuz if I knew what I know now back then he&#39;ll be different  well I did drop out but I did go back to school and I know I did get my high school and right now I&#39;m deposit to another different thing so right now is getting my high school getting back together right now I&#39;m working to another girl I&#39;m trying to get me know either going back to school so the basic basically getting back to school and finishing the high school for GED  awkward like I thought it would
328 okay now I&#39;m going to start at the root  okay  hey  are you okay  yes  fine how are you  I watch California but now I live in West LA  I love the sunshine of the palm trees I love that you&#39;re 30 minutes away from everything straight City  the traffic is terrible  best Early Child Development  yeah actually I teach children how to be safe in a traffic situations  jumper dream job is to be a filmmaker that&#39;s what I want to do I want to die doing that job making movies  well when I was in high school I did a lot of drama theater Productions and I just love everything about film so once I had the opportunity to actually make a film because I wasn&#39;t getting any work as an actor I just got hooked I just love making feel  last time I made a film just this last October made it short film  it&#39;s about three people that connect together they&#39;re completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally  thanks  really mad  it really mad I you know I guess what makes me really mad as when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and she doesn&#39;t pay attention and I have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that&#39;s what makes me mad  yes sucks she&#39;s one of the smartest kids in her school  no it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find a negative go to them and it&#39;s like you&#39;re fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know * 152 deal with that but other than that it&#39;s okay but it&#39;s being a parent is never easy  the hardest thing about being a parent I would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don&#39;t make mistakes or so that they don&#39;t get hurt and you want to give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don&#39;t so it gets very annoying sometimes that you know what&#39;s coming and you give them the info and they don&#39;t want to take it they want to find their own way and watch them get hurt and it&#39;s sad and then they want to come in your life. I tried to tell you but you can&#39;t be mad at them because everybody learns their own way  yeah I guess for a while when you think about it when you watch them go through their struggles it&#39;s hard to watch but it&#39;s a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they want to learn cuz once they get it they got it so however they get it as a pair of your happy they got it  all the love the children bestow upon you is great they yeah they let you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me she always tells me I&#39;m doing a great job when does she know about a great job she&#39;s only seven but you know they have that unconditional love and you just can&#39;t help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you&#39;re a good person so I like that  I got there you know like Albert Einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there&#39;s so much technology out their kids are learning so fast it&#39;s almost like they&#39;re already little adults but they&#39;re missing the steps to being a child they missed going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to YouTube are you know wherever Facebook and in getting it so fast and they don&#39;t know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they it&#39;s not organic anymore children growing up these days it&#39;s not organic it&#39;s sped up its pushed and it&#39;s just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong  me cook just breathe in breathe out or I&#39;ll just walk away from the situation  argued  I argue with my fiance couple months ago about  gosh I forgot I forgot I don&#39;t remember  it was petty yeah they didn&#39;t last long cuz she&#39;s like me she doesn&#39;t like to argue about stuff would like to take care of stuff as it happens and that&#39;s it  my fiance  elk me we met when I was working at at a charter school but at a recreational center we met there and we talked we hit it off we didn&#39;t see each other for the entire year and then we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since  my family were pretty close my brother lives in Colorado and my sister lives in Oklahoma I have a dad that lives in a neighboring City where I am as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away but my immediate family like you know my fiance and my daughter like we&#39;re close and it&#39;s great  I don&#39;t travel enough but I have traveled a couple of times within the last 5 years I just came back from New Zealand so that was a great experience  I enjoy meeting new people that&#39;s the biggest thing about traveling I like seeing new things I like just immersing myself in different cultures and situation and I like just being away from it all that&#39;s good too  well I went to New Zealand not too long ago and I stayed there for a week I learned about Celsius cuz you know here we have Fahrenheit and that was fun I learn how to play cricket I learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak and I learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good I like lamb but they have a lot of land in their Sufi food I can eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is so good and ice cream was good too and other people who are really really nice they say it was a very special time for me to go there was great and they accepted me I love that and yeah can&#39;t wait to go back  yes it was  some of my best qualities energetic a very personable of intelligent I am easy to get along with I work pretty hard and I&#39;m very slow to getting upset about things  no  no  it&#39;s fairly easy  I guess I get pretty moody you know I could be a little little Snappy at people when I don&#39;t sleep well when I have lack of sleep but once I get some sleep in me I&#39;m okay  no no no changes no  you know he would say that I&#39;m pretty funny lacks about a lot of things I enjoy life as much as I possibly can good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help  things that usually  just waking up in the morning it&#39;s always a great thing I love ice cream that&#39;s always good I love laughing if somebody&#39;s laughing especially my fiance cuz he has a great then that puts me in a good mood  thank you  and that&#39;s what I want to do I definitely want to get into acting and really work it and get some really good rolls so he&#39;s going to positive influence he stayed out of trouble he&#39;s maintained a good working relationship with people and he&#39;s always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging  oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he&#39;s my best friend  yeah  yes it is  wow there&#39;s so many  had a nice bag of M&amp;Ms and we have went to a play and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn&#39;t particularly care for but you know that&#39;s how kids are they don&#39;t know how that you know they say they don&#39;t like somebody but you know anyway but we got these M&amp;Ms and Wilder it was dark we start throwing M&amp;Ms and hit them in the head with M&amp;Ms and then we came to school like 3 days later and we were summoned and there was a mock trial to get  so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn&#39;t allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like 2 days  oh man you name it all of scuba diving I&#39;ve only done it twice but I love it when I get back into it like traveling I love exercising I actually like working out now I used to think it was a chore but now I&#39;m really really getting into it that I love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and I&#39;m a happy camper so about it in the family  Eric Rhett  you know what I think I probably regret not going up to Will Smith when I had the chance  yeah Will Smith was coming up the street and I saw him and I got so nervous I jumped in the bushes and I didn&#39;t meet him my boss of the time thought it was really funny but I just I wasn&#39;t ready to meet him yet so but I think I regret meeting him  advice would you give yourself time  advice I would give myself 10 or 20 years ago I would probably say that when my gut told me to do something I should have just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and Analyse it you know days weeks months later if I feel it in my gut I should go for it so go with my gut more  really happy  really happy I had a film festival that I was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things are going right but then once the people came and packed the house I was really happy that we had a packed house at this stuff in front of school so this is about a month ago  let&#39;s see I think right now at this point I&#39;m most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and I didn&#39;t think it could be done but it&#39;s done or close to being done and I&#39;m proud of that I was able to get it done I think I could walk away happy knowing that I gave it a really good shot and I think this movie is probably going to take me in the rest of my film crew buddies to higher Heights  oh really  all right well what was your name again  Ellie goodbye  that was awesome  no

717 okay if you notice that she pauses for more than about 20 30 seconds ahead and press that button it may be an indication that something&#39;s gone wrong  once again after she says goodbye go ahead and press this button and I&#39;ll come back in for you okay  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  and please  are you okay with this absolutely  doing good  enjoying the weather  Houston Texas  the weather at the beach marijuana  I can&#39;t think of nothing really  no I used to I used to be a truck driver but now I&#39;m a student at La Trade Tech so I&#39;m home base now  what do you enjoy about  Siri meeting different people  I&#39;d like to hear  an experience when I went to North Carolina being there for the weekend the atmosphere was great so different beats type lifestyle imagine where to put it up  the party life is different  there&#39;s a lot of clubs over there so I mean I really had a night time during the weekend that I was there made a lot of nice people got laid  did you have a good memory  my most memorable experience  I really don&#39;t know which one to pick out for you I&#39;ve been a lot of places and done a lot of things and a lot of time as far as me having asthma I have an attack it&#39;s a lot of things that I do forget but overall my past has been very good  diesel technology and learn how to do how to be a repair technician for like the buses diesel trucks anything is running out diesel they&#39;ve taught me how to repair engines take them apart and put back together troubleshooting electrical work I&#39;m really enjoying it because I like doing things with my hands and the thing is that they&#39;re teaching me I can use it for the rest of my life and I really is something that I can probably pass on the others so you know I really like it  what do you do now  all right now leave the time I ride my bike a lot going to do some parts of LA a lot of time to go to the beach I like Venice and Santa Monica Beach a lot  just Ashley just seeing this country and not the country but the city has a lot of places I haven&#39;t been I don&#39;t have a driver&#39;s license but just being able to ride my bike and go over the freedom to go where I want to I really love that  all right  what&#39;s your dream job  my dream job  motorcycle racing riding a motorcycle Superbike racing that&#39;s my dream job  me and my family with distant I&#39;m in touch with my dad but as far as cousins and my mom we don&#39;t talk  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling  what is the fastest guy  what do you do  smoke some weed and go to sleep  my zodiac sign is a Taurus so  it takes a lot to make me angry but if it&#39;s something that I know is someone that done something wrong I just simply try to tell them about it to correct them but being physical I tried not to get into that but you know you got people out there to really don&#39;t care about your feelings so sometimes I ain&#39;t walking away not dealing with him anymore  when was the  I&#39;m going through a divorce I just experienced a domestic violence incident where me and her got nervous about who&#39;s going to clean the house so I took it upon myself to I punched in the shoulder and call the police on myself if I&#39;m two days in jail I can order the home has been since January or right now I&#39;m working on my divorce  I wish the best for her and the family meeting is no hard feelings about it you know  and at home if they have an apartment now on they&#39;re doing good but I feel that she should have been more friendly about the way we broke up because she changed the locks on the apartment and I didn&#39;t get a chance to get any of my like my tools and put paperwork birth certificate and whatnot she still has that but you know I feel like they to pick my life up and continue on you know I don&#39;t wish nothing bad about her hopefully she&#39;s happy I know that she&#39;s with the baby&#39;s daddy&#39;s come from Louisiana he&#39;s staying with her now and you know it is  how would I put it I&#39;m not mad about it I&#39;m more hurt the hurt feeling this what it is  I just did I wouldn&#39;t have got physical with her I felt it there was going this way so I called myself being away from the home a lot and she kind of noticed it but yeah he got me the convinced that you know me being a husband or you know a father figure that I&#39;m supposed to be spending more time with the family so they can I change my perspective but when I done that my daddy call it putting all my ducks in the basket where she&#39;s got my social security number you know my information everything I just open myself up to her which have fell today you know it was a waste of time is a bad move but you know  Life Goes On  you feeling  I mean guilt come from doing stuff that you know you shouldn&#39;t have done  oh I don&#39;t do that in life I don&#39;t steal I mean live by the Bible so guilt I don&#39;t have that  Harley decision  I just made the decision that actually out of a reaction in a sense it&#39;s not hard for me to make a decision that&#39;s not like me  tell me about Nevada  dealing with women their best of the wrong women  I know it in the future that you know women are different that the ones who have done such is that individual is not an all-woman type thing but  right now in my life I just need the right one  I don&#39;t like being by myself I felt that me being married would alleviate that but I married the wrong one evidently hopefully that if I decide to take that step again that it be the right one this time because you don&#39;t you know you&#39;re getting old and time than went by and you can&#39;t bring that back  yes I&#39;m a veteran  okay  how have you been feeling lately  how I feel  I never thought about it but me I feel good I mean I&#39;m healthy I&#39;m just glad you know you my freedom maybe in Black you really think about the fact of your other race being locked up a lot of history and I feel that me I&#39;m doing good  so you know to me I&#39;m happy about life  my association with women is different  I don&#39;t like whole conversation with women that don&#39;t know like I used to it&#39;s hard for me to like how you say start a relationship or friendship rather with a female now when it comes to men I&#39;m not gay and I don&#39;t do gay things so we don&#39;t get that out of the way but as far as me and you know I don&#39;t have friends but when it comes to being advice you know I experienced that a lot of God few students classmates rather that kind of like leaning toward me when it comes to how would you say me helping them and I kind of like get in trouble for that so I guess you would say of me being outgoing I rather think about other people more than myself  my dad told me it&#39;s time for me to start thinking about me so I&#39;m trying to get my mind into that frame where you know I&#39;m just concentrating on better in life for myself now  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  find out what I had due to doing the day is no problem but I sometimes worry about the next day in about you know what&#39;s going to happen or how I&#39;m going to handle it  I thought you know you sometimes get the dreaming about how thing is going to be in if it goes to the world  you know the dream leads to Didion or a bad situation you&#39;ll wake up from it it&#39;s not considered a nightmare but my body I wake up  and I don&#39;t sleep well I not doing today I mean I&#39;m not irritable  emotionally unstable but I don&#39;t have problems sleeping if I sit too long in one spot and I know that I&#39;m going to be there for more than 30 minutes I can go to sleep it&#39;s no problem for me  have you ever been diagnosed with  no  have you been diagnosed  no no depression  when was the last time  when men the ex-wife in a kids wear at the beach  we was all having a good time  positive influence  I really can&#39;t think of any way to slow down a floor that would be my daddy I mean you know he&#39;s made it to life and then made a lot of good things for people where you can sit back now and not really worried about things you know he just taking his last few days once you know one day at a time in a sense he really concerned about how I&#39;m doing because the time of the seasons I made you know when it gets to

457 turn on yes  spectacular this is an interesting experiment  I am from middle of nowhere Iowa  May 2nd of 2007 so exactly 5 years at 6 years ago and frequently like once every couple years  the weather exist so it&#39;s more extreme and then it&#39;s exciting  winter in Minnesota  I took approximately  the drive-in that&#39;s that&#39;s about all it took the lights the lights took care of the rest  I really love that it&#39;s a giant concrete playground at night time so that bicycles have free reign of the streets I like all the art I love the fact that there&#39;s so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and then if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here  oh you know the traffic the exceedingly High Cost of Living  I&#39;m sure you can  not nearly as much as I would like to have been a little bit  I like not knowing exactly how things are going to go like the fact that it forces me to  deal with people to deal with situations in ways that I normally wouldn&#39;t have to  last year I got to hang out in San Marcos for a little bit after I split up with my ex and then after San Marcos I went back to Iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then I brought my little brother to Los Angeles  last week managed to go on a bike ride for ciclavia  as I use basically a Rolling Green Light the entire way down Venice Boulevard and so he made me made a bunch of like national news and was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on topics and stuff they we didn&#39;t bat an eye we didn&#39;t blank because it has normal for a friend that wasn&#39;t even the most absurd thing he&#39;s done lately I was just at a happy normal Sunday but our group of friends is so unusual that a normal Sunday for us is Extreme for everyone else  I used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you Los Angeles  once I found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing  bombastic for the first time and it stuck  if I weren&#39;t already the most relaxed guy already I would probably do things but when I&#39;m really stressed out I do all sorts of stuff  usually I tried to enlist my friends call me doing art project  what temper  panics cuz I really wanted to make him not hate me and I mostly failed  hard on him I mostly unless I got by with a couple of scrapes on my Hugo  when when that all went down I tried to talk to him but I got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of  having my rubber gloves up I managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over trash cans it was not my most graceful moment  something you feel guilty about  I feel guilty about lots of stuff I feel guilty about eating more often than everything else  because I really love junk food it&#39;s really good and I have very little food will power these to be that guy  tell me about the hardest  I&#39;m not sure what the hardest decision I ever had to make was made a lot of hard decisions  I guess  it&#39;s very hard to leave Los Angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but I wasn&#39;t even that hard cuz it pushed me to do it so  tricky questions  oh you know Brooke collarbone severe pain get surgery on the LC like the time  tell me about  know my numbers are important I have lived a spoiled blessed life and if I changed anything then it wouldn&#39;t be the same universe I like this universe  little brother lives here he&#39;s awesome he&#39;s actually right outside waiting for me my mom is crazy and my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy I&#39;m pretty crazy  but  since most of the rest of them live so far away and don&#39;t have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparse  jackrabbits been pretty positive influence Mi lately she is a magical creature  well there&#39;s a part where she&#39;s intensely physically beautiful is the part where she  manages to hit me with the best inspiration words there&#39;s the part where she  actually works on the exact things that make me excited there&#39;s the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there&#39;s the part where she is 100% kind and caring all the time  all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that  she does this all  without wanting anything in return  smitten  what a funny question how do I know them as though she&#39;s multiple people how did you know I know her through my  bicycle friends  the hard part is going to bed but as soon as I get to to sleep land time pretty much there until an earthquake hits so I can get to sleep  poorly but then I&#39;m a pro at it so it doesn&#39;t matter  less verbose and that&#39;s about it my dark circles get slightly larger and I&#39;m pretty much the exact same dude because I&#39;ve been doing it most of my life  so stoked that I might as well be on fire  because the universe and its infant  I suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the Archer City Park Simon&#39;s ISO  as a fortunate and  vaguely aware being it&#39;s my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this  yeah my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and feeling more and more inspired all the time if I could just work on the motivation I&#39;m beside  have you ever been  not since you asked me on the phone a little while ago now  I know I used to think I had it but who knows at this point those while ago  I was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then I moved to Los Angeles and started having fun and then the rest is ancient history  2013  working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling on our project that all my friends helped him put on that&#39;s that was pretty nice that&#39;s a nice feeling  awesome  a very good question I&#39;m not actually sure I&#39;ll have some later today though  I guess I&#39;m  Susie Astic I am  historic and I am  I&#39;m going to have to say highly analytical  be nice if I could get my superpowers back would be pretty cool  like turning on some of the fancier finely-tuned and delicate Machinery that Chinese medicine has clued me in to inside myself  to play tough one I think the thing that I&#39;m most proud of would probably be  I&#39;m not actually sure  00 all sorts of stuff I&#39;m working on that  don&#39;t masturbate so much  what are some things that you  Jackrabbit really bad puns and dessert  no problem  hi Ellie  okay  what a hoot
403 thank you  at the door  hi I&#39;m Ellie  are you okay with this yes  how are you doing today I&#39;m doing really good  I&#39;m from Granada Hills California it&#39;s the San Fernando Valley part of Los Angeles  I love the weather I like the diversity in people I like how you can go to a neighborhood and it&#39;s not just one racer kind of food I love the beaches all the activities you could go do the theme parks aquarium stuff like that museums  this smog  there&#39;s a lot of creepy guys  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I&#39;ve pretty much child around La I&#39;ve been cross-country and back three times twice with when I was 17  what do you enjoy about  I like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live  I want to hear  when I was seventeen I ran away with my boyfriend to Upstate New York to Watertown it was a like a Navy Army kind of town we had an apartment there are it snowed a lot we sold antique Spirit living  awesome  getting calluses pressed houses for the Sunset Strip Music Festival through friend and getting to meet rock stars and hang out I like the private parties  I&#39;m very outgoing I love people  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling  what is the fastest guy  what do you do  am I go to the gym and work out quite a bit I find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going I really notice if I don&#39;t work out a couple of days I feel a little more tired than normal and is it helps me feel good  I&#39;m pretty good at it I&#39;m very, I worked a lot of events and jobs where you&#39;re dealing with like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to you and you have to remain calm and you know they&#39;re the customer so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you&#39;re getting paid cuz the money they&#39;re spending so I&#39;m good at resume resolving like consumer complex and stuff on the job  I had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and I kind of started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that I didn&#39;t know that she was embarrassing and what she was saying to people was very mean and you know and I wonder like if you&#39;re talking to people like that they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is LA  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  I really don&#39;t feel guilty about anyting decisions I&#39;ve made in my life I think I&#39;ve made really good decisions and I always stick with my moral compass what I&#39;m doing I grew up in church so I haven&#39;t gone in years but I still have those values and you know the rules the Ten Commandments and stuff in my head  I had a slumlord landlord and I wish that I called you know the proper authorities and follow through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn&#39;t up to code  a few years back I was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back to where he was from and after a few months you know he was coming early and going back home I decided to move there and I had just started you know this business is doing event planning was picking up and I decided to leave there and try to do it there and you know on the east coast and it didn&#39;t work out but it was tough deciding like should I leave LA and make this jump and try something new and experienced something new or stay and what I was doing  I was I had a degree in Dental Assisting I did that for like a year I didn&#39;t like it and then I was sending Communications like radio and television broadcasting and journalism  I&#39;m somewhere I&#39;m doing a van work and I wrote for a magazine a couple years and I&#39;m trying to like get a website going and then have like where I&#39;m controlling my own riding and what&#39;s going on instead of writing for someone else  I always wanted to ride and was always into the news and music and art growing up I really like Connie Chung she was like a Channel 4 newscaster in the eighties and I love Barbara Walters  I was a nerd  relationship with your  tell my sister she doesn&#39;t talk to any of the family and I have a good relationship with my mom I never really knew my dad it doesn&#39;t bother me  I have cousins and stuff but everyone&#39;s scattered across the country so I don&#39;t really talk to them and phone we just communicate on Facebook or like Twitter  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep so I go right to sleep when I get tired I just go to sleep  how you been doing lately three good energetic I&#39;ve been motivated to go look for more van work you know event planning stuff and really grinding in more than I was  I mean it&#39;s kind of hard cuz you got to talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else  I mean I&#39;m generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer the one I know dies  I want to say that I&#39;m just super like oh my God happy all the time but it&#39;s like an even Keel that I feel pretty good all the time  I&#39;m very talkative and friendly and I could approach strangers and talk to them Eddie&#39;s and I could adapt to different situations and even if it&#39;s not my scene or situation or group of people that I&#39;m used to I could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adopt  what are some things you wish you could change about you  I want to make more money  I&#39;m over in like second grade the people used to make fun of me cuz I was very tall and skinny and I had like straight A&#39;s were in the highest grades and Lacrosse so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe  stuff like that  very talkative she would just say that I talked to everyone  and I&#39;m very friendly and if you need help that I&#39;ll help someone you know  a recently I went up to Oceanside and visited a friend I&#39;ve known years and we just went out for burgers and hang out on the beach and we got her two-year-old son and like chicken in the park and played and it was really nice and they was cool visiting or I didn&#39;t seen her in six months and it was really fun and I want to go again and  I like the area  I guess maybe I could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people  I think I pursue it but I think maybe I could put a little more time and day into it  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory  I don&#39;t really know anything like  that we want a raise or not happen  okay  is there anything you regret  no I feel good about my choices I made and I think I&#39;m on the right path and a lot of things I wanted to do than balls rolling and I&#39;m you know getting things done I&#39;m not as big as I want to be but I feel like I&#39;m on my way there  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20  I&#39;m like 10 years ago I would have told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as I was  my friend we call Mojo  Mojo has a magazine and I just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep riding and keep doing the Vance and keep on the ball I&#39;m rolling and he&#39;s one of the biggest people you know my life tummy you&#39;re talented you could do it you know he&#39;s just a really good like motivation for me  you know being published I&#39;ve been on TV shows and just getting my own event thing going and  I have a lot of people who read what I ride everyday and follow-on I just think it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s not exactly honey where I want to be but it&#39;s great start  and I work to get to that point  great thanks  computer-related survey about
468 yes I&#39;m okay with this I&#39;m pretty ass a little tired but some pretty good for the most part  on Redondo Beach  yep  at the beach or the mountains I love it go surfing in the morning or snowboarding the day  if you&#39;re hiking up in these mountains Santa Monica Mountains to be exact  I don&#39;t like the traffic I don&#39;t like the congestion a few people here and I don&#39;t like  the price of the cost of living in specific areas  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my  I&#39;ve been trying to actually  last year was the summer of really Road trippin and getting out there if my girlfriend  we&#39;re looking at a Costa Rica and hopefully South America this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the South Seas in the southern states but I&#39;ve been in a Canada been to Mexico and Ecuador iron  been to various States here and they&#39;re trying to get out there  I love meeting new people I love experiencing new things trying different different foods that are native to that local area and  she&#39;s part of the journey I just I love exploring this you know this planet we call Earth  just recently went to Seattle and Canada with a couple friends and  who&#39;s gorgeous we have flew into Seattle and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to Vancouver Canada and saw British Columbian why was he gorgeous just very large beautiful trees the  the climate was nice the ocean was right there&#39;s people are great it&#39;s just a fun trip all around  one of my most memorable experiences  was probably the  the trip we took the Colorado last summer and me and my girlfriend flew into Denver and we didn&#39;t really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people were living there and just the day before we had contacted them and tell them we&#39;re coming the area and they&#39;re just showed great Hospitality they picked us up at the airport lettuce crash at their place for a couple days we even let us use their card it&#39;s for the state and go to Wyoming and see the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and it was just everything worked out very well just everyday is there something new and fun to do  yeah  I study business management and economics right now  I&#39;m I&#39;ve always wanted to own my own business and I figured Mansion PA  Agera Foundation to build on and I&#39;ll learn more about so I decide to go to management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and then economics was just too just for long-term Investments are really want to start running some stocks and ETFs and mutual funds and start building my profolio up so I figured now that would be great way for a long-term investment financially so that&#39;s why did my economics  yeah I&#39;m really stoked was  one of the best decisions probably mine my life  I consider myself more outgoing them I&#39;m pretty friendly hiking don&#39;t mind to open up to people and stuff  how to be outside like to go hiking want to go working out the gym but I most like to be outdoors I love nature and just be outside just  just puts me at ease  from pretty good for the most part I&#39;m pretty mellow chill guy and when I do get angry here and there  it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before I know it I just it just blows over I don&#39;t tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just cuz there&#39;s no need to Life&#39;s too short for all that  see I can&#39;t remember the last time I argue with anybody  I have no idea  probably when Maya  my brother and my girlfriend got a little little argument I&#39;d like to birthdays ago and it&#39;s been awkward kind ever since  I wish you would just handle that right then and there rather than letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it&#39;s just awkward for both parties I was just go to communicate with both of them and told them that the differences aside and was just communicating try to come up with a solution  but now it&#39;s just awkward  yeah it does  tell me about the hardest  the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make  and the Tuffy  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had too many tough decisions really say the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make on maybe  not moving to Colorado for my undergrad to three years ago was a little touch of slick kind of think what if  but other than that nothing has really been too tough on my life that was really that hard of a decision  when you feel guilty  don&#39;t really feel guilty about anything pretty good person I think and for the most part I can think of any then  so now I could wish I could erase my memory  nothing really be honest  I love all my memories are usually positive for the most part I know it&#39;s kind of  wait for somebody to say but I&#39;ve looked pretty good life and  I&#39;m happy  yeah  it&#39;s cool I&#39;m pretty independent the most part so when I do see him here in the ants if we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but I want to see if it&#39;s good you know I like to say hi and show him I love him still and it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t mean to like not contact him that you&#39;re always contact me but  it&#39;s good for the most part I guess is a young adult  my girlfriend&#39;s family  they&#39;ve been very positive in my life I wasn&#39;t for them I think of you in a different direction  just in high school I didn&#39;t really care about higher education I didn&#39;t care about  really thinking long-term  and I just seeing them and what their family dies and how they think differently like through higher education and how to get somewhere in life and if you do these things is to work at will you too and they&#39;ve been very successful they own their own no accounting practice and  seen that influence me to achieve higher in life  pretty easy for the most part I just close my eyes and  wake up in the morning  I&#39;m tired sometimes  it&#39;s enzyme a little drained and  maybe a little groggy in there  and that&#39;s it  showing pretty good for the most part a little stressed out just cuz finals around next week and I really really want to do well and just seen a close out this last semester and I graduate in two weeks and for the most part that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing I&#39;m really nervous about but for the most part I&#39;m really excited and looking forward to going to Maui for a week after graduation fired up and fired up to see what the future holds we&#39;re going to be my girlfriend 11 weather trips are planned for the summer I&#39;m just excited be done with school for a little while  yeah  I have never been diagnosed with PTSD  I&#39;ve never been diagnosed with depression  the last time I felt really happy with paci my girlfriend graduate couple days ago she had just graduated from nursing school on Monday and I just hear walk across stage and stuff just cuz we&#39;ve been together for 6 years Tina go through the nursing program for 5 and it&#39;s just ups and downs it&#39;s really good to see somebody just drive through and Achieve what they wanted to cheat and just been really proud of her  yeah  probably outgoing friendly Positive Vibes all around adventurist  love sports team player knows how to be a leader in there  and it&#39;s a little outspoken sometimes  not really for the most part  no not really  feeling more motivated to do something motivating right now I&#39;m just because I&#39;m just done with school and I&#39;m over at that I just don&#39;t feel as motivated but I just want to be more motivated and determined  right now and that&#39;s not  I&#39;m not going that way right now so  no biggie  how man I couldn&#39;t  can really think of a Time  Owen caving 2 weeks ago that was a lot of fun we went up to Sequoia National Park and I went caving with the trainer CNA classes like this site Recreation tourism management class and Kayden with an elective and our professor was at the world-renowned cave specialist and they took us to these various caves in the Sequoia and just me and these strangers are my classmates and becoming really good friends with him was a lot of fun and rappelling down in a cats climb back up going through different rooms and shoots it was a lot of fun  Dallas yeah  10 or 20 years ago I&#39;d probably say to stay more focused on school little lesson the social aspects and kind of stick with one sport to see how far that he got you  sometimes not playing hockey hockey sometimes  and that&#39;s pretty much at now  I&#39;m proud that I&#39;m really proud that I&#39;m graduating my bachelor&#39;s and I&#39;m looking to get a full-time job or get a law firm now so I have something going for me  really try to be motivated and determined person long-term long-term thinking lies and well-rounded person  and I don&#39;t want to spoil the world

462 alright wonderful  okay thanks  yeah  I&#39;m okay  I&#39;m from Los Angeles  oh the weather the weather the weather the weather the beach the weather the beach the laid-back miss the driving instead of public transportation  and a sporty  I really I don&#39;t know the lack of I don&#39;t know there&#39;s not a lot I don&#39;t like about Olay it&#39;s compared to most cities I really it&#39;s my favorite and I&#39;ve lived around the world I love it I love La a lot  I&#39;m sure you can tell by me  yes I&#39;ve lived in Paris and I&#39;ve been around the world a lot  it&#39;s just dumb it&#39;s fun and it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a blast it&#39;s good to see new places it&#39;s good to get to get to experience all the  fantastic I&#39;m sites and in in cultures  well I mean I I I tended to actually do a lot of them I probably would do them differently I think I&#39;m more developed as a person now I lived in Paris for two years so and I lived in Spain for Spain was fun Spain Madrid is a party town and then and then to these were all work they were all work so that was working so it was on his grind and you didn&#39;t really appreciate you know what was around you so much and then I mean I still I still love going just to you know vacation spots like a Y A N Dent Tamika I&#39;m still just really a sucker for that kind of stuff  I guess Madagascar was pretty much like just really bitching because it was it was in the eighties and it was like you were seeing a lot of people that have never seen white people before according to the guy driving us around I might he might have been lying but it was just it was bitching and Africa was pretty much the best Senegal and Madagascar  I&#39;m right now about to go for an early childhood education degree and then I did a little bit of a paralegal but that was really just to just to get the just to get the Skype and I didn&#39;t really have any concept of what I want to do now I really do  I have I was saying to Rachel actually I don&#39;t know if you guys are able to overhear I really think that the way the school system goes right now is it just it it turns people into into I&#39;m just a just a doggy dog. You know I don&#39;t like the way I think it&#39;s told draining the school system right now and I feel pretty bad for everybody so I want to try to fix that  that would be my dream job that&#39;s so I&#39;m excited like I want to go in a direction that I want to go and yeah that would be my dream job is to work with sort of getting kids on it more organic Universal you know trajectory  I think it could be done I don&#39;t think it would be done via any sort of legislation except here and there I mean that always ends up becoming you know facade in Farsi itself anyway but I think there are ways I&#39;ve always reached kids anyway and I&#39;ve always felt where I was coming from and so I think you know there are ways to sort of buck the system without even talking to the system  I guess I&#39;m just a combination of the two I don&#39;t think  I don&#39;t know actually I&#39;m kind of might even be working that out there might be some outgoingness to overcompensate for what&#39;s actually shyness and vice versa.  Yeah that&#39;s cool  I definitely try to reflect and stay in a pretty Lucid space is often as possible so  a lot of lying down at the moment I&#39;m in transition so there&#39;s just a lot of and I hang out with my dog&#39;s a lot so that&#39;s quite soothing why I try not to do I don&#39;t really do anything that&#39;s to can&#39;t unless it&#39;s time for like time to drive to a job or time to you know go make some things happen meetings and stuff but otherwise I try to stay in a pretty relaxed space most of the time so it&#39;s not like breaking but you know and I meant I&#39;m assuming I can&#39;t believe summer is coming so I&#39;m going to swim some more to  when I&#39;m truly outraged it comes out and then I I&#39;m I&#39;m I&#39;m hitting some kind of bad part right next time I&#39;m fighting for my child so there are times when I will just cuss up a storm just to get off some steam  a little bit but usually pretty much there&#39;s always you know someone in the periphery that gets it and and you know it&#39;s like that bumper sticker If you&#39;re not outraged you&#39;re not paying attention so usually some kind of Sanity can prevail  oh well I mean these are also times where I just can&#39;t find something in the car and a bit when I argue with people it&#39;s been a lot of the times when I&#39;m being flat out you know sabotage drawer definitely when  you know I lost my temper dreadfully with unfortunately the woman that gave me birth because that she is intrinsic and a lot of I mean she&#39;s pretty much horrible person so I recently lost my temper with her  I felt like  I mean I I like again I think I should have said this just now I felt in a way good because I get it you know which is as opposed to not getting it which is even worse but I guess there&#39;s another side of the bank of the thing to get to to where you can be a little more constructive about it it&#39;s like you know you get to a point where you&#39;re glad you can actually see that there&#39;s a horrible travesty going on but then you have to figure out how to deal with a horrible try to stay  but so I mean I didn&#39;t feel like shame I really honestly didn&#39;t feel shame I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t feel there times when I feel like it was stupid to lose my temper just because there are people that will try to use that against you that&#39;s all but I never really feel bad for being angry about what I&#39;m angry about  well when I was pregnant I wish I had  like I said I went through such an Awakening about realizing when I was being sort of undermined that that demanding my respect became a huge issue and when I was pregnant I ended up being so disrespected in the place cuz I was being a hippie on the beach for 6 years so I was it felt like I was being so disrespected in the place where I was set to be when the child arrived at I stormed out via what was a good survival mode before but left me jumping out of the frying pan Into the Fire and they got my kid so  yeah  it&#39;s fucked up  I don&#39;t want to erase anything from my memory I like having everything Consolidated and cohesive I don&#39;t and integrated I don&#39;t want to erase anything from my memory  well did I get it right or did I get it wrong I guess the hardest decision was whether or not to sign sign mediation agreement with DCFS in and I should have said no let&#39;s just go straight to court because that there is nothing wrong with me I just happened to succumb to an SSI check via bulshit with my mother&#39;s and I should have just been you know brave enough to just go in there and do that and instead I chickened out and did their mediation and they played me out  over consciousness  it&#39;s horrific horrendous Borgia quality Intrigue and sabotaged it&#39;s bad  that&#39;s okay  someone that I mean  there&#39;s been  you know there&#39;s been some  some great people that again from a far I have not sort of really achieved a real great ability to build relationships and I&#39;m working through that great writing it right now and I think that&#39;s a lot why don&#39;t I have my son but as I&#39;ve grown in developed I have seen encouragement from like-minded souls and you can see that and say that&#39;s wonderful and but otherwise you know a constant you know contact with someone that&#39;s really good for me it has been hard for me to get to that point  how is your day  not so easy if he says it all  I&#39;m being I&#39;ve been I&#39;m not completely centered and then there&#39;s been some actual you know people thinking it&#39;s funny to harass me or jolt me as they walked by and so there&#39;s been actual harassment and stuff like that  I&#39;m still pretty Pollyanna doubt I still look forward to head and try to be as pleasant as possible  I&#39;m tired and drained and a little bit frustrated because that I know that I&#39;ve been sort of that I sort of have a bit of my energy and and space being usurped and I can tell and I don&#39;t know how to get through that and passed it  no  no  there are I&#39;m basically a very very very happy pretty much list out person but this fighting for my son has me sort of trudging areas that it is it the same trees that were thrown in my Road in childhood before I realize I was such a happy person or thrown there again so I&#39;m going through some of the same pitfalls and mistakes but you know during the day I&#39;ll I&#39;ll think something completely true and organic and I&#39;ll just stare at something to wow that&#39;s beautiful and I&#39;ll be reminded pretty close to my spirit so I try to stay there 24/7 I&#39;m pretty spiritual that way  I mean if I had one that was willing to say all the nice things about me gets pretty competitive out there that you know that I&#39;m this is off you guys  that I&#39;m funny and that and that  I think that&#39;s bad I&#39;m done funny and that I&#39;m good and that that I&#39;m trustworthy  Legacy West  just not necessarily change but grow through my ability to connect with the people I want to connect with  and disconnect from the people that manage to to drain me  I already said I regret the thing with them leaving the place where I could have delivered my son even though I was being abused  get the fuck away from your mother  you know and like a lot of  and and yeah and two open your eyes look what look what&#39;s going on  I&#39;m proud of my spirit and my Outlook and my my access to what&#39;s really going on in the world and my awakeness I&#39;m just proud of me as a

My head  well  well don&#39;t say anything on the way back and made some bad and bad Investments back about 10 years ago  how&#39;s more  Charlie like what I&#39;m looking for more trusting of people like that people in like them I thought were expert in their field and I inherited some money I was little bit careless with it and I just kind of had a Vibe you know that nothing would go wrong kind of little bit of night-night tivity and unfortunately some bad financial decision is kind of put me in a bad position for the rest of my life and fortunately he got because of a medical conditions I have talking to rebounding you don&#39;t make it all up so I was saved mainly financial and investment decisions that I really regret  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to me  wow  that&#39;s a tough one  I can&#39;t think everything about my head  okay  well I don&#39;t really have too much family left the only one I have is my it just me and my uncle and we could we communicate on a regular basis he look but he lives in Clearwater Florida so long we were okay but  he&#39;s like it isn&#39;t he&#39;s in his eighties and I was young my my 50 so we can we do we have kind of small talk and he&#39;s kind of concerned about my well-being but it&#39;s kind of somewhat of a on a shell of a really deep and that he&#39;s got his own problems so we don&#39;t really get into too deep of a conversation  other than him it&#39;s really there&#39;s not really anybody else to have I did that part makes me a little depressed cuz I don&#39;t really feel I have anybody I can really count on a really confide in  it is challenging I don&#39;t know why but I do have a medical condition something that might be part of the problem and I have a little bit of BPH so I&#39;ll be out of town for the restroom and answer your question to make a long story short it is challenging to get a good night&#39;s wake up feeling a little bit tired aching but it is difficult  how deep is feeling lately  well I&#39;ve been feeling okay I mean  be kind of feeling now actually trying to address issues that I haven&#39;t taken responsibility for  but I feel a bit of calmness as of late  have you ever been tagged  no  well I just say yes. The questionnaire and I&#39;m not positive if it was technically diagnosed with it I did take a Venus call the mmph the Minnesota multi-faceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got two questions about my my well being psychologically too and I think some of the answers to the advice that I see a psychologist or psychiatrist I didn&#39;t follow that up on that because the philosophical differences but I think I might have a mild case of depression  well you don&#39;t like I said I&#39;m just kind of like kind of goat along in life and I&#39;m doing okay but you know highlights passed me by so I haven&#39;t really fulfilled my my goal was kind of like alone I&#39;d like to have a girlfriend I don&#39;t have a girlfriend so that&#39;s kind of tell me who I feel I can get close to and I&#39;m not really in my life right now so what is a certainty I&#39;m having some kind of financial uncertainties so overall not doing as good as I&#39;d like to  okay  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  that&#39;s a good one really happy  let me think about that a minute  well actually it wasn&#39;t that long ago actually I want you  okay I know that one actually I think I&#39;m going to answer I hope that old lady she was at a trade show it was a Anaheim with natural products Expo so it&#39;s pretty nice we we had some nice meals afterwards there&#39;s a lot of exhibitors giving out really nice samples it was an Anaheim some kind of got a chance to get away from LA and  met some interesting people are they were very outgoing they&#39;re willing to like having experienced their product or service and I was around people that I work with who I got to socialize with old was pretty happy back then and it was about a month ago  yeah that was  best friend and I really have a best friend but  I would say  I don&#39;t know technically I really don&#39;t have a best friend so she heard me answer that so I can&#39;t really come with an answer to be honest  I like to be conscientious and I do have flaws Mary but I think the overall unconscientious I try to be honest for the most part I&#39;m on the major issues I might you know they would have likewise or you know I&#39;m not perfect I&#39;m not going to come to the serious stuff I tend to be pretty honest I&#39;m a hard worker. Good work ethic  can you be pretty calm for the most part  play regret  what can you elaborate on that  well  I just well just overall I regret them  not be a little more assertive in my earlier  earlier life if I put myself in this position is going to go back to my financial decisions that was sort of that sort of like my albatross in my life I made some bad decisions and unfortunately the kind of pay the price for now so I kind of like sort of like living sort of a popper existence right now which is kind of kind of depressing so I would say that&#39;s part of what I regret most of all  advice would you give yourself 10  well I would say to really you don&#39;t analyze kind of go with what you really feel  I think I was going with other people&#39;s opinion other people&#39;s advice I was kind of going away from my basic beingness you don&#39;t like the way I really felt like I&#39;d make you aggressive investing which if it turned out good it would be like for like when the lot I would have been well off for the rest of my life but unfortunately it went the opposite way too many eggs in a basket so I kind of regret it going with my gut feeling and let other people influence me and I could by Nature I&#39;m a conservative person so I should really do more conservative Investments another is my life at 10 to be more conservative but I kind of made some aggressive financial decision so that&#39;s pretty much  can a local doctor that area as far as what I regret  wow  that&#39;s interesting I&#39;ve been doing a lot of working weekends so well I do like to be profitable to do something where I can actually you don&#39;t make money that&#39;s sort of like my bread and butter time could you trade shows but I&#39;m not doing that then I&#39;m like maybe watch some men you know I like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game go to a movie go with some friends so just going to kick back but my main primary primary focus will be on earning earning money on the weekends  huh  that&#39;s interesting  what&#39;s prerogative  I would say that I live by and large all of the wholesome life I would say I never got myself into any kind of really bad  bad advice you know I  I love the pretty hoe salsa my wife I said I&#39;ll probably I don&#39;t really proud but as far as I stay the course as far as not going down any real deep to speak  okay  my pleasure  that&#39;s pretty interesting is it improve your technology on a lot more like you&#39;re talking to a live person Siri  it was kind of a little bit more Academy can tell us like a more like a like a video game this looks more like a real person communicates like  return for not trying to deal with her but it was some other guys and I think I know what it was but it was a little bit more  I can&#39;t reveal all the details but this is see no more comfortable more natural  yeah
376 hashemite hair you see what you look like oh my God  all right now  so this picture is not based on a real woman at all  okay so when she said I&#39;ll just wait for the buttons not working and I&#39;ll come back to you okay  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  creative  yes  I&#39;m doing okay it&#39;s still morning so  I&#39;m from the East Coast Massachusetts  yes  I moved to LA when I was a child with my parents pretty much didn&#39;t have any choice in the matter  I haven&#39;t been back to the last time I was back there was that three years ago for Christmas  LA&#39;s very hustle-bustle there&#39;s a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don&#39;t care about the other person here in LA and which Becky is the East Coast that the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors are friendly to your neighbors and Tammy way that you see in the street  so yeah  well since I was a kid I was fairly young at first it was rough I was getting in trouble a little bit in school but after all that surpassed I did fine in high school and stopping even took some college courses  well I love the beach and I love the mountains I like to go hiking and I like walking along the beach I just live a few blocks away from the beach so it&#39;s easy  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes  do you travel  no not at all  it&#39;s not interested I&#39;ve been to Mexico a couple of times when I was younger went to Ensenada but other than that I&#39;m not interested in leaving United States especially with what&#39;s been going on lately overseas  okay  actually child psychology and I was in the nursing program for a little bit but I had some problems at home which caused me to drop out  that&#39;s right  I don&#39;t have one to be honest I admire people that are doing the job that they love I mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money I&#39;ll grade is that so  I&#39;m pretty outgoing when I meet somebody at first I might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment as to if we want to continue communicating with the person or not but once I decided I like that person or whatever I I talked a lot so  hey  yes  I like watching movies I like I used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn&#39;t been so great so it&#39;s hard to get into a good book  not good at times I have a  some Outburst every once in awhile to say depends on how angry I get  I yesterday and it was with my partner and actually be honest I don&#39;t remember what it was about It&#39;s just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and I don&#39;t appreciate that and if I feel that I&#39;m being disrespected or whichever I&#39;m going to stand up for myself  at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and I say what I say what&#39;s on my mind I do not purposely going to hurt people&#39;s feelings or anything of that nature but I won&#39;t be bullied and I won&#39;t be may I Won&#39;t Back Down if I feel like I&#39;m being challenged so  last year my mother died  so  I wish I handled that differently  it up to it that upset me  so  tell me about  I think I&#39;m going to pass on that one too because that&#39;ll upset me more  that is terrible sometimes I sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you&#39;re done working and doing everything that you have to do in a day you&#39;re tired but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it&#39;s like I can&#39;t I get up and then I&#39;m wide awake I&#39;ll go out and living room turn on the TV and watch TV I&#39;m lucky if I get 3 to 4 hours sleep  are they triggered by something  maybe because I do have a lot of my mind you know thinking about bills and the stressfulness of work and in all this other stuff so that&#39;s probably a big burst part of it  but it&#39;s not difficult it&#39;s just frustrating cuz when your mind goes on overtime mode it I just affects everything your concentration your sleep you&#39;re eating  everything so  I don&#39;t look grouchy especially in the morning I&#39;m not a morning person I like the nights but I don&#39;t like the morning that&#39;s like leave me alone until I get my first cup of coffee so other than that I&#39;m okay  well I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been depressed for quite some time and I&#39;m still having difficulty cuz after my mother died four months later my uncle died so I had two deaths last year so I&#39;m still reeling and trying to  get myself back together just recently I&#39;ve started pursuing like interest that I used to do that I haven&#39;t done in a year because of what happened  I just I might get angry little easier I sleep alot I eat I overeat  I get tired very easily cuz I&#39;m not getting much sleep so sometimes it&#39;s hard it seems like I&#39;m struggling to get through the day  yes I have a psychiatrist that prescribe me medication on a regular basis  oh I was diagnosed quite some time ago probably 10 to 15 years ago and it&#39;s just something I&#39;ve never gotten over I don&#39;t know whether or not you can so I&#39;ve always taken the medicine  I was  arguing with everybody in my family my friends and stuff like that and I was feeling desperate and hopeless and I had attempted to take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then they start treating me I start seeing a therapist so  well right now I&#39;m not going to a therapist because my insurance will cover the psychiatrist and a therapist but I am working with a friend of mine who had no some Avenues to go to seek help for a therapist and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s really going to help me I mean sometimes it depends on what kind of therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and Ramble On and you&#39;re thinking my God what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kind of feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions  tell  change it  they said I haven&#39;t been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist medication  there&#39;s been no changes really  I probably would be doing fine because I was doing great before my mom passed away I was her caregiver and  even though a lot of times I filled I felt overwhelmed or lacked patience with her I still was a heck of a lot happier  then I am now  tell  I would say when my son was born years ago  do you find it easy to be a parent  I&#39;m not a parent anymore he passed away  so  and that was difficult as well  I&#39;m extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because I get everything done that I&#39;m supposed to get done even though sometimes I feel a little scatterbrained and  you know those qualities are are admirable and people that can keep their word and and be responsible  excuse me  oh I have lots of regrets  things that I&#39;ve done in the past I&#39;m not too happy about but you know I met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker live to never regret so you know you can&#39;t go back and make changes it&#39;s too late so why you don&#39;t dwell on the situation but this is what I&#39;m just a lot easier said than done  I&#39;m at the advice kind of get person you know I don&#39;t really  give my friends ain&#39;t kind of advice I mean  I find most of the time people don&#39;t listen to you anyway so why bother I just State my opinion that&#39;s all  what right now I&#39;m on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died I was a lot thinner when she was alive I just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot and I&#39;ll sleep eat sleep to eat and so now I&#39;m kind of like on a diet trying to lose this weight his very unhealthy for me  I think it&#39;s been a long time  actually there&#39;s really nothing because now I just keep my mind busy I haven&#39;t been to a movie in ages I don&#39;t I used to go out shopping all the time I don&#39;t now so it&#39;s been it&#39;s been quite some time since I&#39;ve been content and happy with who I am and what I&#39;m doing in my life right now  spend your ideals  my weekends like on Saturday I&#39;m usually working on Sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house  run some errands go shopping for food you know that kind of thing so it&#39;s not if I was younger you know it would be fun you know got clubbing or whatever but I&#39;m too old for that now  really there&#39;s nothing that I can think of  there&#39;s nothing that I can be proud of  set a good like comedy or whatever I like to watch that  sometimes my partner might do something stupid which I like because I like make fun of them  but that&#39;s it you know could maybe go out for a walk on the beach that&#39;s it  okay  no problem thank you  bye  there&#39;s somebody talk for her or she&#39;s just talking to me really  okay

charge of what it is I do  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing I can go both ways on that  sometimes I&#39;m I&#39;m standoffish shy but for the most part I&#39;m not going  well I guess this

fishing I like to watch a good movie  an entertaining movie hello the guys where I live I like to watch like TruTV cops things like that because you face it every day  out on the street or on the bus or driving wherever  or wherever you might go in any anywhere now but pretty much just relax  being able to focus on something it&#39;ll take your mind off other things that might you might be having a problem with her might be stressing you out that work for instance  how are you  very efficient I like to think things through before I  I get angry at anyting  and  it&#39;s not that I get angry at I don&#39;t get angry at idiosyncrasies that type of situation or people&#39;s habits or anything it&#39;s  I got angry at a lot of society I see things popping popping up popping up in society that seem to be going towards the out-of-control direction is opposed to the getting things under control and  but now I&#39;m pretty good at managing my anger in my  how would you say my reaction reactions  two different situations  let me think something I can&#39;t really think of anything significant  tell me about a situation that you wish you were  okay  give you an incident  a couple weeks ago  no being a hoe something I feel guilty about  picked up my mother was spent the last four years of her life and a sub Acute Care Center here at to Little Company of Mary from diabetes and stroke to pick my dad up  every morning drop him off in an hour or so with my mother and then go on to work and then after work I pick him up and come to drop him off and then I&#39;d go back all the night she passed away  I picked him up and dropped him off and then I had to go home for a little while and I was going to go back that night and I fell asleep on the couch  I like lean I know it&#39;s like  the hardest decision  all right back to think about that  that situation that I just explained about the night my mother passed away at falling asleep and when I got back up that this morning to go pick up my daddy said your mother passed away last night  what made it really difficult and she was by her Capel mental capabilities were were completely there she or cognitive awareness everything she knew what was going on but her body just gave out  and nobody  yes I was in United States Coast Guard for 6 years  I spent four years at coast guard air rescue  and my last 18 months was right here in  Chronicles  when it was here I think it&#39;s in Florida now  is actually pretty good Duty I made rate really quick I just spent a couple days in the brig here and there but I got out with my fully five status  that&#39;s one of the big that&#39;s really the only true regret I have is I should have stayed in and and been retired by now  17  I had to  well I&#39;ll my grandfather pulled some strings and got me an appointment  for a needle Academy and but my physical exam worse me out of that my exam because of bad depth perception and it kind of wanted me to come in just as the general duty officer but I wanted to be a pilot that&#39;s a No-No No-No and I backed out of the whole thing and your later  I thought about it and go would like to still get drafted  oh yes it was definitely a better choice that put me through my school my education and Ladder years  taught me quite a bit of discipline  levels of self-esteem  did you ever speak  not as such we arrested a few people on drug bust in that type of thing back in the 70s  but not combat for saying not not armed combat  most of it  it was great cuz the last like I said the last 18 months was right here in  and I live  Los Angeles Los Angeles County so it was basically a 9 to 5 job to me  so I had no problem going back in the transition anyway what were the six years that I was in the service I saved a lot of money u.s. savings bonds of course so I saved enough money to be able to relax for a couple years to decide what I really wanted to do and that&#39;s when I decided to go back to college get a couple degrees saying manufacturing mechanical engineering quality engineering and I&#39;ve been doing that  79  it&#39;s been pretty productive productive  I pride myself and the knowledge and experience I picked up over the years  to do after the military  machinist machinist engineering  quality control quality assurance  it&#39;s been  quite a lot it made me realize I had a future instead of just when I was younger you know just kicking around thinking you were going to live forever and not really focusing on anything for the future  you got the military has been a very good benefits touch with the GI bills  back then like I said it paid for your education so I had that option and I took that option  you&#39;re sorry to hear that but I took the option to use the GI bill for my education  fire during their I&#39;m going through some side effects with my new inhalers I have a COPD bronchitis chronic bronchitis and they&#39;ve been giving me some dizzy spells and coughing spells in the morning when I get up and have to take these inhalers and it really it exhaust you it takes a lot out of you  but I&#39;m getting up there and unfortunately I&#39;m still smoking on the lighter side of that I&#39;m not as smoking as much as I used to  but other than that I&#39;m doing pretty good I&#39;ll be moving out of US Vets in a couple of months and I need to pick up with the pace on that to find an apartment  have you noticed any change  no I&#39;m still focused it before work focused on getting into a permanent residence  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  usually it&#39;s usually it&#39;s pretty easy I have those times when I&#39;m tired to the point of where it&#39;s hard to fall asleep and sometimes I can just go to sleep right away  how long does thinking of maybe something that happened during the day like you mentioned earlier in this conversation things I could have handled better things I could have done a little differently  what are you like  Trump fired  little grouchy I guess a little grouchy but a cup of coffee and I&#39;m usually through it and over it  no  back before I go to the service I was diagnosed with what do they call it bipolarism  but I never really thought much about it  did you know you get up when you get down  last Saturday when I went to go deep sea fishing  got a really nice red snapper that was about that be  where was what With Friends  my grandfather  Oasis spend a lot of time with him on summer vacations when I was a teenager  my dad was in his retired army so he was away so I guess my grandfather was more of my my father&#39;s been the male figure in my in my life  he passed away 1972 no 1970  21 * 2 * 3 * 72 and was 1972  best friend  easy going  fishing  what are you most

I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s so I had to actually like act you know I&#39;m in the audience but I have to like pretend like I was interested in what you have to say but it looks so I kept looking at her like that like there&#39;s something wrong in my eyes no I just thought I was in a doctor&#39;s office and they had it on and it&#39;s like God it was funny cuz there&#39;s these guys like winking at me on the way I like that celebrity 8 dividing sitting there it&#39;s like I hated every minute of it but we got sewing machines free sewing machines $200 sewing machines that day it was yeah so it was worth it was worth it but I was so embarrassed yeah only if you get stuff it&#39;s worth it otherwise are so stupid shows are so I can&#39;t believe that&#39;s what I want to television  so embarrassing  oh okay  right on okay this is so weird oh gosh I hope she&#39;s nice to me I hope so okay hello  are you okay  yes  fine just tired  California  from Hollywood  not too much  talk to me things I like about it  the people  it&#39;s not clean  too much crime too many drugs  eye makeup and hair  a little bit  not too much I just arrived  very difficult  I&#39;m getting a little old to be thinking of a career but  I just want probably get married and have a little security that&#39;s all just be a wife again  a little bit close but everybody&#39;s pretty much passed away  I play FarmVille on Facebook  I&#39;m good I don&#39;t really have a temper  with my ex-husband about money  people lying cheating conniving drug addicts you know just ugly people people that are  hideous and inside you know  Jesus Christ that&#39;s about it  my mother when she was alive when she still a positive influence but  nobody really but  Jesus  memorable experiences  I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t really think of one right now  gosh  experiences  all I guess like maybe modeling that was pretty cool yeah  yeah  I was just kind of  thrill like to see yourself in magazines and pictures and stuff you know I didn&#39;t understand how it could have been me but then my photographer told me he was like well someone has to do to might as well be you so oh well and it&#39;s true so that was cool  just kind of fell into it by accident  I&#39;ve always yeah yeah I wish I did it I took it further but I couldn&#39;t  really happy  I don&#39;t remember  I really don&#39;t  I really have a best friend but I&#39;m sure  there anybody would describe me as outgoing  no  yes  how was the 1984  yeah  I can deal with it  so I had to see a psychiatrist  horrified couldn&#39;t sleep  panicked  major anxiety  oh yeah  yes I do  it could be if you see the right doctor  it gives you the opportunity to talk to somebody and  hopefully they can give you answers must have him don&#39;t they try to find the answers and side of you get it out of you but it&#39;s just good to be able to talk to somebody that&#39;s kind of biased neutral  really depressed  extremely depressed  poverty  yeah  yeah I&#39;m a lot more tired I sleep longer and  I am  I just don&#39;t have the drive motivation that I did before  just try to be strong just have to get through it and now  yes  there are  not really  I&#39;m an open book  well I would say perfection is but that&#39;s not really good quality cuz it can get dangerous  I&#39;m just artistic I&#39;m good at a lot of things  I&#39;m really good at a lot of things but  well I&#39;m good I&#39;m a good hairdresser makeup artist I crochet and knit really well make jewelry  not good with computers or phones though Electronics  yeah  okay perfect house or well when I&#39;m not depressed like this I was a perfect wife the perfect wife  hell yeah  but not anymore cuz I&#39;m divorced now but it wasn&#39;t me it was him  he was on drugs so he chose the drugs were too much problems  yeah it does  it&#39;s really hard because it&#39;s like the drugs are his mistress  how do I what  who  yes  now  well I don&#39;t really consider myself an introvert  yeah  I have a lot of regrets but there really wasn&#39;t anything I could do about it so there&#39;s really no point in regretting it  cuz you do what you do and you make a decision and then  it&#39;s already done so why I regret it why bother you no  make sure that when you marry a man that you ask him if he does drugs or alcohol  that&#39;s one for sure that was the only question I didn&#39;t answer ask I I didn&#39;t know  first lot of things  a lot of stuff  I don&#39;t know  just the things that I can do  that my talents that&#39;s it  well if I can have my Starbucks  and my orange Gina I drink orange juice everyday and I smoke cigarettes and fortunately but it&#39;s always good to have those because you know I&#39;m addicted to them and then it&#39;s like it&#39;s something really  good and healthy at night time and it will basically if I have something to do if I have a goal of somewhere to go something to do like today then  let&#39;s meet a good man yeah

you&#39;re good  she&#39;s good except for you know it&#39;s like the one I can she hear me by the way the one I always come is weird and distracting other than now the one  yeah she kind of made a mistake on one part
426 okay hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in his face  and please  are you okay with  yes  I&#39;m all right  stop alarm  weather  the women  opportunities  Spot It  racism police brutality Injustice  no  not much of a exploring type person  okay  psychology  it was one of the classes I excelled in the most so I decided to change it from business in psychology  are you happy  yeah yes  no  Tom on record label  nice  mom is my really hard but you know taking one day at a time just I guess you know stay focused  Lil Bit of both  I tend to be sorry and situations I&#39;m not comfortable with our new too and I&#39;m outgoing and places are more comfortable with  I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  turn the lights down low and listen to soft music  I&#39;m getting better over the years I think I&#39;m  pretty decent now compared to how I used to be  got you in trouble yes ma&#39;am  due to the lack of I guess you can say controlling my emotions I have been incarcerated at the prison  okay  I&#39;m not sure I don&#39;t really have a recollection of my hardest decision I ever made in my life  probably few days ago with the girl I was talking to and I was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness  yeah  I frustrated  because  you know how you be put in a certain amount of effort and you expect  you know the same effort by the other person when you&#39;re in a relationship in the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you can set yourself up for failure or so  you know I guess I&#39;m just learning  a lot of situations over Hank differently  probably the most recent was a  I got into a physical altercation with an inmate when I was incarcerated and that made me that&#39;s what sent me to prison in and I had to do a lot more time  and if I handled it differently  probably wouldn&#39;t ever want the president and I probably would have been home a lot sooner than originally happened yet  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory are several events I wish I could erase my memory  probably  My First Girlfriend  she did something really extreme it wasn&#39;t necessary my eyes and it and it could have cost me my life I think that that that&#39;s a recurring thought that I wish I could completely erase memory along with the good memories as well  a few YouTube fights shootouts getting job getting robbed  you know those things I think those inhibit me  I guess to explore certain areas of life that I&#39;m not comfortable with south of the few things that he&#39;ll be nice so I can erase it completely  yeah  hurting people I didn&#39;t need to be hurt emotionally especially  few women in my life are my past  probably put my mother through certain things that shouldn&#39;t have to go through along with my close friends and family as well  tell me about your relationship with your family  used to be Rocky growing up but as I got older mature and Discerning spirits that I&#39;ve been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it&#39;s it is pretty decent this is pretty soon  I would say my mother  yeah mother  oh she she she had her share experiences negative and positive I might her the struggle she been through  she she she has experienced difficult economic hardship growing up but that didn&#39;t stop her for raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her Masters in just just overall being a good person and she also about her mental health issues as well and probably not the best of family that she could have been raised with social so she&#39;s kind of like a inspiration to to me and other people as well so I Was Your Mother  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it&#39;s not easy so yeah it&#39;s not easy  I can tell you I&#39;ve always had sleeping issues why you should just take like over counter sleep medication or NyQuil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it looks like it&#39;s a negative effect really  the medicate I don&#39;t know shitt I don&#39;t know but I just stop taking it cuz I don&#39;t like to feeling drowsy  not good at all  can you tell me about that  yeah I mean I recently got released from prison not too long ago  older now and a lot more responsibilities and I feel like my life is not worth supposed to be I feel like I could have made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and things that I&#39;ve been through and the whole nine yards so  there  I&#39;m sorry  Saul Good  Cicero  yes  two-and-a-half 3 years ago  myself I am I was I was just tired of  not I don&#39;t know I guess School kind of made me sick help because I started to understand myself by my brain works you know so I decided to seek help maybe  to better my life  yes I am  yes  yes I do actually I do  better decision-making better tools to reflect on choices how to control  certain situations better yeah  well instead of just always reacting On Emotion no matter what kind of motion it is I stepped back in and then assess the situation and I&#39;ll to see what&#39;s what&#39;s the best way to to react towards situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally mature and just has positive outcome  tell me about the last time you felt  I was laying next to a beautiful woman who cared about me and the feeling was Mutual so that was probably the most happy  oh my goodness  spontaneous  outgoing  sometimes a little crazy  fun  that&#39;s about it  nothing  like I said earlier just you know hurting  the few women that were my life my past and  my friends are family that&#39;s about it  oh shit  school is really important  how I carry myself to people who are surround myself with and what I choose to do my free time so there&#39;s a few things I would tell myself  good music  good thing basketball  sex  I

family lives so  you know it&#39;s good to be around your family  and just a lot to do out here  I wouldn&#39;t say a lot like maybe once or twice per year  memorable in a good way I would say having my children at three children so I guess that&#39;s the most memorable  right now I&#39;m just doing liberal arts so General Studies nothing specific  I do take a lot of I do take a lot of science classes because eventually I do want to pursue education in Psychology but that&#39;s later on  my dream job I really thought about it  I don&#39;t know  honestly I really don&#39;t know  I wouldn&#39;t say shy I&#39;m a little reserved I think there&#39;s a little difference  oh no not really shy  to text me a little bit longer to warm up  I don&#39;t know I just like to read people before I really open up to them to see how much I&#39;m willing to share  and how much I&#39;m not willing to share  it&#39;s okay I mean I love my family we have our ups and downs  specifically I guess with my mother you know is a little bit more up but I&#39;m the only girl so it&#39;s expected I have three brothers so with that being said it is what it is it&#39;s good when it&#39;s good and when it&#39;s not good  it could be better  probably watch TV or you know does not got my pick up a book or something magazine see what&#39;s going on in fashion just something to keep my mind off things  pretty good I also play games I like to play games on my phone on the computer things like that I wouldn&#39;t say I have a temper you know just average you know when things upset me I deal with them but I don&#39;t overdo it I don&#39;t you know explode or anything like that  probably what&#39;s today Friday probably my see was it yesterday no day before yesterday actually was with my mom it&#39;s it&#39;s so funny the argument with about she feels that because I&#39;m a mother a wife and a mother that I should not have a social life  meaning I should be at home knitting or something I don&#39;t know so it was small that wasn&#39;t a big argument just you know I mentioned that I may go to a comedy event and she was against it I said well it&#39;s really not your decision I&#39;m an adult so that was about it  that&#39;s about it  recently  probably  I mean thick I&#39;ll probably should have you know  oh I know when my husband and I were discussing relocating from California I basically put my foot down and said I wasn&#39;t you know willing to do that and I probably should have kept it up in mind because there are some pros to moving or relocating but I guess at the time I really just didn&#39;t want to hear it so I just put my foot down and said you know we&#39;re not going anywhere with staying here I probably should have been more understanding because he is from  you know he&#39;s not from California so he&#39;s probably feeling a little homesick and I should have took that into consideration  guilty probably not spending as much time with my kids it&#39;s not because I don&#39;t want to spend time with them many not altogether like usually when I spend time with my children it&#39;s separate when I always together unfortunately because my middle son has autism so he takes a little bit more time so I wish that you know we could all be together and I do feel guilty about that  but it&#39;s difficult  so I try to give them their own individual time  but it  hardest decision probably I don&#39;t know  my former occupation my former job relocated for about an hour and a half away something like that little bit over an hour depending upon traffic and was a good paying job great benefits great people but I had to basically  play myself off from that job which did create a financial hardship in my family but I didn&#39;t have a choice because of our you know situation with our son and having only one vehicle for transportation if it&#39;s a lot of other factors you know I basically had to stop working and that was a big decision but you know I always say happiness over finances you know you can all I can always you know find another job but you know having my family together and being happy that&#39;s a different story  that&#39;s about it  oh that&#39;s easy probably when I had my face injured when I was in the military yeah I wish I could erase that I mean something that I see everyday when I look in the mirror I don&#39;t dwell on it it&#39;s just there but it is a mark on my face that I didn&#39;t deserve  he knows a traumatic experience but it&#39;s been about  I&#39;m a 15 years or so it&#39;s been quite a while but if I could erase it yeah that would be yet  yes I was in the Navy  for 4 years  19  didn&#39;t have any other options it really wasn&#39;t  planning on joining the military but I didn&#39;t want to go back to school at the time I just figured you&#39;re going to the military with give me the background that I needed and money for school so that&#39;s about that shows  yeah  I mean can change it I mean I&#39;m not unhappy I&#39;m at a lot of nice people you know so that was good but there was some issues that I had the military that I had not went you know probably would you know when a lot differently but you know you can&#39;t change the past  no glad I did it I&#39;m not really for that uptight person  yeah it&#39;s unfortunate you know but now I did it  the transition where was it was a little difficult at first you know having to adjust having a fine at the all career and you just  not having that  how do you say  I guess I felt like comfort in the military because I knew that I was always going to have that pay check it out when I was supposed to do I always have a roof over my head you know things like that you know the civilian life basically  it&#39;s your meds you don&#39;t know like you lose your job Monday or you know whatever so that&#39;s alright transition I got used to it pretty quickly  thank you  I went to school I started working with a Communications company  I did some medical care as well  got married and have children  maybe a little bit more responsible I know that for a fact you know if people my age at the time you know didn&#39;t have a lot of responsibility most of my still living at home you know at early age I was out on my own no pay my own bills things like that so it did get a little bit more responsibility  I&#39;m feeling okay  I already have any complaints  I mean I feel fine I don&#39;t have any complaints about my life you know it is what it is to take it one day at a time that&#39;s about it  yeah probably nothing really to speak about  cheetah and thought  yeah  nothing dramatic  whenever you go to sleep I usually go right to sleep well. As soon as my head hits the pillow but you know I don&#39;t I don&#39;t talk to her or anything like that  very cranky  very cranky Laura boy I guess  no not at all  no not at all  I feel like I&#39;m always happy I don&#39;t know if people tell me that all the time and say I&#39;m always smiling and things like that so probably just morning when I woke up  thank you  my mother as much as we argue you know she&#39;s such a strong person and you know she&#39;s really been there for me and my kids and I just love when she isn&#39;t the person you know how she&#39;s always doing things for people to see  you know just a good person  she means well  but she&#39;s very opinionated  probably  Billy Anna how is he is driving  he probably say I&#39;m typing to look gullible  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what she would probably say  I don&#39;t know could be  I want our family vacation we actually drove which was different we usually fly so it was a new experience you know going on the road with the kitties  thank you  wow that&#39;s a tough question  oh I didn&#39;t really  oh you&#39;re welcome  bye  I press the button  that last question I didn&#39;t really answer it but she said thanks got it so I left it at that  I don&#39;t know what thank you for  should I get an answer  okay sorry  oldest recorded is Ian sorry  they&#39;re going to think I&#39;m bored
707 okay but but okay but I don&#39;t stop until it&#39;s just stop  I&#39;ll go by okay  okay okay  sure  when I bring her up now  and please  yes  good  where are you from  Long Island New York City  the weather people  traffic smog some people  not lately now  why just don&#39;t have the funds or the time at this point in time  Hellboy  buying my first custom chopper  I studied small engine repair consumer electronics repair then I went into the residential construction trade  what you do now I&#39;m retired I&#39;m disabled  what&#39;s your dream job  being a Formula 1 race car driver  somewhere in the middle  tell me about your  it&#39;s good we have a good relationship  I play poker Texas Hold&#39;em  pretty good pretty good  what&#39;s good  when was the last  00  two days ago it was about him always slamming the door I asked him not to do it because it&#39;s very loud when it slams and he just doesn&#39;t care and and I got mad and I yell at him  probably my marriage  okay  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  not being a better husband to my ex-wife  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to  oh boy.  I really can&#39;t think of one right now  tell me about Nevada  00  probably  some of my earlier years I in my early 20s on the things I&#39;ve done  have you ever  yes  17 + 1/2  well all about five or six of my friends were going in so I want to go with him  are you happy  yes I I kind of wish I would have stayed in though  no I didn&#39;t know if there was no Wars going on or conflicts going on while I was serving  it was easy I had no problems adjusting  I just kind of bounced around from job to job and then I I got into a little trouble went to jail for a little while then I got out and pretty much got my life together  how did serving in the military change you it made me more confident made me physically stronger too  that&#39;s about all I can really think of it as far as that goes  how have you been feeling  as a rule pretty good  just things are starting to look up more at least financially so that&#39;s a good thing  no not really  how is he  usually pretty good unless one of my roommates is walking around the house all night like you sometimes does  little irritable  usual I control the irritability though  yes  I&#39;d say about five years ago and it was just symptoms were I was hearing voices  paranoia  yes but it was by an event that happened  I am  Jewish by birth even though I don&#39;t practice and  I was jumped by five skinheads  and I was able to handle two of them but the other three got me and beat me up pretty good  how do you cope  you know I just  deal with it as it comes I guess you know usually I don&#39;t even have to deal with skinheads anymore because I don&#39;t see them too much but I was in that one situation where it just happened where they happen to be there  I was tired of hearing voices and I knew I was hearing voices  do you still go to therapy now I know I&#39;m pretty much over that I&#39;ve learned to overcome  do you feel therapy in Gainesville  yeah I think you can help people some some people I can&#39;t help just they&#39;re too far gone but I think  the majority of people yes it can help  well I think when people have a chance to  express or vent what&#39;s going on or what&#39;s bothering them it takes away some of the tension and stress and they are better able to cope with whatever their problem is  I&#39;ve just learned to deal with things  a lot easier  when is the last  oh  how to say it was  when I bought my last vehicle  oh my friend  it&#39;s been a very positive influence  yeah he asked me if I need things he&#39;s helping me to  be financially more secure  through through working partially with him even though I&#39;m retired I do a little bit of work with him and it&#39;s a way to make some extra money that&#39;s pretty much needed  how do your best friend  probably as honest loyal and  be there for him whenever he needs me  all well I&#39;d say it was a reunions of sorts of the old Hollywood crowd that I used to hang out with  nice  yeah it was fun  well of the things I had which I no longer have but I had accomplished something I had my own business I own two homes several vehicles and all the toys and everything that goes with it  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you  yeah she&#39;s done with me
353 yes I&#39;m okay  Pennsylvania  well I was in Boston for a couple years and then I moved here about three and a half years ago but I just wasn&#39;t satisfied with call you my life  maybe once or twice last year and got to go back once  a year  definitely safer and definitely Amalur why dismiss it cuz I have lost family back there but Ellie is okay I mean everyone loves the climate here  not too easy I have two really good friends here and I have a boyfriend I&#39;ve done with for three years so that helps he&#39;s from here but it definitely took a bit of adjustment  no  advertising Communications  no I&#39;m currently working and I said I&#39;m not working right now at the moment  I want to be a naturopathic physician  so basically versus Western medicine and naturopathic physician is someone who help someone with the symptoms and doesn&#39;t just treat the symptoms for threesome as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look a diet exercise just a variety of things to actually get someone to live a healthier life versus medications are things of a commonly prescribed now and Western medicine  how did you do  well one of the great things was when I came out here to La I was exposed to the debris which I had never heard of living on the East Coast  sometimes  Grand very particular about the people I like to surround myself with and I don&#39;t like to socialize with a lot of people I mean I tend to like small intimate groups and I don&#39;t tend to like to be in larger a bigger groups  when people don&#39;t take an account other people&#39;s feelings  I usually  try to go for a walk if I get very irritated  I&#39;m usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over into Gallery become upset  let&#39;s see  I was up with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  yeah it was he&#39;s other and I think they&#39;re just a little bit mediocre than not the best lawyers  I have no idea  I&#39;m very trustworthy and loyal  I can&#39;t read deeply so I like to try to help other people and I would like to try to cheer people up so I think that&#39;s I would be some of them  no  yes  just a few months ago about in the last 6 months  I was experiencing  mental issues that I&#39;ve never really came across the for paranoia and anxiety and I knew that it wasn&#39;t  I knew that it wasn&#39;t that I can overcome it by myself  a lot better I&#39;ve been doing a lot of yoga and meditation kind of seeing things from a different purview or and I never purview but a different View and  that&#39;s how but there&#39;s definitely times where I kind of thing back into thinking about the event especially because the vet cost me the stop working  I think I cannot have a difficulty being in public I&#39;m still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that&#39;s something may happen so so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so I&#39;m not that comfortable going out there in a day at 10 to go out in the mornings and evenings and I don&#39;t like to go into places where there&#39;s only one way in and one way out  well I&#39;ve been gradually trying to increase how much I&#39;m outside  and I usually just deep breathing I do a lot of breathing exercises and I just try to stay that basically what I&#39;m thinking or what&#39;s going on with me is not real and that  I just I try to try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since the last couple months but before I very much pretty much stayed home  it&#39;s been good it&#39;s been good to hear someone&#39;s feedback but I feel like I&#39;ve gotten more help with just my inner talk was just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  I do  well I feel more like myself which is a huge Improvement  and I am more  cautious in AeroGarden some ways about my thoughts and about my decisions well I&#39;m not so I&#39;m not so you know I&#39;ll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that I want in my life  how is your day  it&#39;s gotten better I&#39;m okay I&#39;m better now the first three months it was very difficult I couldn&#39;t sleep through the night and I woke up maybe two or three times and would be away for a couple hours but now I am sleeping through the night again  groggy feel foggy and out of it  and just low kind of depressed  I think it&#39;s been awhile  working I&#39;ve been a workaholic spending time with my family  yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading  I&#39;m very close  what is that  well my parents cuz he&#39;s always been very supporting and loving giving me feedback about my decisions or what I&#39;m choosing to do but allowing me to make my own decisions my own choices in life and then my sisters are just always been very you know I just was checking with me I&#39;m the baby I&#39;m the youngest in the family so they always looking out for me and just checking in with me and my boyfriend shoots man with this incident that happened he&#39;s been very usually support of what just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when I&#39;m feeling and not wanting to go out and Publican and being aware of that that is not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop for  I&#39;m running errands without having a lot of anxiety  I&#39;m most proud of  the jobs the work that I&#39;ve done the people I&#39;ve helped  maybe that I took this job where I was assaulted at that would be it going into retail and to unsafe environment not listening to my gut  what advice would I what  to recklessly pursue your dreams that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted  Etsy  well cooking I really enjoy I really enjoy cooking  so I made some roasted vegetables just a time I&#39;m cooking I just really enjoy it we have a garden so we had collard greens that came up and some Chili&#39;s and cauliflower so just using preparing that for my boyfriend and I  buy thanks
447 yeah that&#39;s perfectly fine I&#39;m feeling great it&#39;s an early morning I don&#39;t have school  born and raised in Los Angeles California  the fact that you can serve snowboard and like do to drastically different things in one day  coming from the neighborhoods I&#39;ve lived in I&#39;d say the population of  lower socio-economic backgrounds it&#39;s like a cesspool almost for young African-Americans and it sucks  not really I&#39;ve been to New York Connecticut Mexico and Texas but pretty young  mostly if I&#39;m traveling by plane just decide in the air is amazing it&#39;s remarkable  the first time I went to New York I was about 11 years old and I made sure I got the the window seat on the plane and just a feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but we left at night here in LA and it was the next day in New York so it&#39;s kind of confusing getting used to the time change and the first thing I remember doing is getting a slice of New York Pizza it was it was delicious  yep  graduating with the bachelor&#39;s degree in Communications so I can go into the military as an officer  what made you decide to do  actually like would I don&#39;t know it&#39;s like you got to have a plan it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;s just falling into place and it seems like it&#39;s going to fall into place for me  what&#39;s your dream job  to be honest job that doesn&#39;t exist  however you can get paid to do nothing  yeah but probably  I was definitely shy as a kid but I&#39;ve grown into myself through the experience of college so I&#39;m way more outspoken  I write music and I work out mostly so if I&#39;m feeling stressed out I just do a set of push-ups and lifting weights  I&#39;m pretty good I saw a therapist when I was a kid for about a year  and I don&#39;t know if he told me to just be able to control my emotions and I don&#39;t think I do it in the best way because when I&#39;m angry I do decide to like just bottled in my emotions instead of letting them out in their appropriate Outlets  not really it&#39;s been more of a in interpersonal thing that&#39;s I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know  probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that than Hu  so many  I guess in my senior year of high school I waited till the last minute to apply for the UC schools and it was unsuccessful because I didn&#39;t get to turn in applications and I&#39;m pretty sure I would have been admitted so it sucks but hey  tell me about  that is an intriguing question  I&#39;ve actually no clue  the death of my grandmother  sure  my grandmother died when I was 11 years old she raised me from the time I was born because my mother was unable to take care of me she raised my sister my brother and my cousin is well and her five children so she&#39;s the matriarch of our family and the closest thing I&#39;ve had to a mother it was tough but it&#39;s going to be 7 years dismay next on the 30th and I&#39;ve grown quite a bit No More Tears  I&#39;m a foster kid so I was emancipated from the Foster program about 2 years ago now but my immediate family are pretty close with him as much as I can and my foster family they&#39;re awesome I&#39;ve known them since I was 5 so it&#39;s been pretty cool  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep fairly easy I fall asleep pretty quick it&#39;s not a problem except for when my back&#39;s hurting and then it&#39;s a problem  a little moody in the morning I guess I drive more aggressively  a little stressed about a few problems that I can take care of but I shouldn&#39;t stress because either can do something about it or I can&#39;t mess this way things work  can you tell me about  Usher I have a few parking ticket not parking tickets are not moving violations but their tickets and I was unaware of if you miss Court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn&#39;t be excused from not been making your court date so I have 3 failure to appears in court with tickets that are thousands of dollars and I have no money so  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s pretty tough to deal with when you&#39;re trying to make something out of your life but  there&#39;s so many barriers and obstacles that like you you didn&#39;t foresee so I don&#39;t know it gets stressful at times and yeah  thinking about it for periods of times some days I just sit and I&#39;m just lost in my thoughts and I don&#39;t really communicate to anyone because there&#39;s nothing anybody can do for me early so I just bottle it up like I do everything  not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing I believe  no  no  really happy why is that such a difficult question  I don&#39;t know I&#39;m pretty content with everything right now I don&#39;t know about extreme happiness everyday is just the same day seems like  dunking across the street at the Clippers center is a basketball court there and I&#39;ve been working on it for a while and I finally got up yet  I have 4 close friends that I&#39;ve known for over eight years each and I don&#39;t know Studios hard-working  determined I don&#39;t know  yeah  probably my metabolism which I don&#39;t really have control over some I don&#39;t know I&#39;m pretty content with myself  tell me about  I think in my sixth grade year of grade school I was I wasn&#39;t the best of students but I had a teacher who was diligent and like he felt me the whole year but I learned a lot and I developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation I overcome after feeling so bad and down  the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because it wasn&#39;t for his like sternness I don&#39;t think I would have gained the discipline to be where I am at now in college and stuff so  I remember this time I was in the desert or up in Joshua Tree with my best friend and his dad and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully and his Jeep would get over a rock so it was it was pretty yes it was kind of weird and I thought I was Superman I try to move a rock that was thousands of pounds didn&#39;t work but yeah we eventually got out without going to be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time I got to drive in the desert when I didn&#39;t have my license owes fun  about that day or in general  other than like the UC thing like what I didn&#39;t apply to the schools and time I regret that  I don&#39;t know I was I was 10 years old 10 years ago I probably say to myself  no clue that&#39;s that&#39;s an

422 what is my hair doing over there so I see myself again  it&#39;s a little better  so this is mimicking her actual positions  total ask someone to have a conversation kind of threw her  okay thanks  hi  I&#39;m not a therapist  are you okay with this  so how are you doing  all right  originally originally I&#39;m from Korea  I went out with a year old  yes  almost never ever been to Korea once  I love the weather and being by the ocean and the culture has a lot of things to do with the food was a lot to like  the traffic  it seems like  we&#39;re having a lot of economic difficulties in the parking tickets or super high sometimes I&#39;m really annoyed by our government  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  fire shoes  did he say buy your shoes  your shoes aren&#39;t showing I have traveled a bit and sort of traveled I haven&#39;t traveled in a little bit in a little while  oh just  it  it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here it&#39;s exciting and it makes me feel like I&#39;m actually I&#39;m really living cuz sometimes we&#39;re stuck in this bubble here in LA and seeing other places you realize that you know life is about a lot of different things that you don&#39;t think about everyday  well  one of my trips I went  I went to Singapore and then to Thailand and it was when I was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to  he had he was a sales engineer for a systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this is kind of like a company thing so we went to Singapore for a few days and that was really interesting you know of course it&#39;s a lot different over there it&#39;s not just like going to Canada or something but they had a big reception in the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principles of company which is all fun and after Singapore we did some chores in Singapore this really isn&#39;t interesting experience it&#39;s really clean there and it&#39;s really it&#39;s not a lot of crime but the government is very is it&#39;s a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to Thailand and that was almost as really completely different cuz like jungle we went to  Phuket little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to Singapore just in a lot of different ways with her and just bring it was nice and everything was very cheap had a massage on the beach for $8 and it was interesting  he has an hour for $8  well I&#39;m in school right now and I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t finish school and I was younger because and  had health problems  so here I am I&#39;m I&#39;m just doing my General Ed right now I&#39;m going to SMC  yeah I&#39;m happy  call my dream job would be to be a veterinarian but I probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily ocelot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and and in a Veterinary capacity  I think I&#39;m right on the cusp it depends on the environment and the people I&#39;m with and how comfortable I am but I&#39;m really outgoing when I feel comfortable with people and I&#39;ll be really reserved if I&#39;m not  well I mean aside from sleeping  I like like relaxing things like going for a bike ride on the Strand or if I&#39;m at home I&#39;ll just like reading  a lot of times I can just lay there and  my mind might be doing things but I&#39;m kind of relaxing  I really good I don&#39;t have  I would say there&#39;s certain things that  they can really like make me  like when I see Injustice has or things like that then  I mean I can really feel it but I never just likes laugh a handle or throw things or even you know yell  show me some arguments I mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument  I would say last summer  when  I think it was after a baseball game there&#39;s a group of us and we went to  we went to have shabu-shabu after the game and and I think  and I know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a tenuous friendship like she&#39;s a good friend in some ways and she&#39;s a traffic kind of distant in other way so I don&#39;t consider her like someone that I would confide in and you know it was any problems but sometimes we just have she&#39;s very touchy and she&#39;s got the same sense of humor I do so I think she had said something to me during the night which kind of bother me but you know I just kind of  that&#39;s just how she is and then I guess I said some things that she  spell were  I wish he gets really offended easily I think but after that we didn&#39;t talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we&#39;re friends again  but like she never has never confronted me  ever had  hardest decision  it was leaving my ex-boyfriend  how did you do  well  it wasn&#39;t  it was a long time coming I mean I was thinking about it  for like 5 years  you know he wasn&#39;t like beating me or anything he&#39;s a really good guy but we just had a lot of  we weren&#39;t always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so I had thought about it and thought about it and  we are already engaged but we&#39;ve been together for a long time so  I don&#39;t know  I was always is always on my mind like should I get married or should I not and then finally we were just always having  we&#39;re always went with the word I&#39;m looking for  we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and I just decided that I was going to leave and I did  it was really hard it was it was the hardest  decision of my life and I can say that definitively  and  but I I think it was for the best  who&#39;s probably leaving my job  for well to help my friend start a business in Nevada  and when I when I I really like my job I mean it was it was pretty good it was right over at the beach and when I told him that I was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me in a different position which is awesome  and that was really stressful for me because  I already promised my friends have to leave I would have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn&#39;t  for her wanting me to come over there it was really really stressful and I stress over it for about three weeks until I actually laughed and when I went over there  like we had we had made agreements about how much they were going to pay me and blah blah blah when I got there everything like she didn&#39;t remember telling me that I needed a certain amount and the other principles of the company where you know it was a hard situation cuz she had she had talked with me but they hadn&#39;t talked with me and they&#39;re like well that&#39;s too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange and they were all when I was I was surrounded by Mormons and I don&#39;t have anything against Mormons but it was very different because I was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there so I would say that&#39;s when it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s  it just a pivotal point in my life and I think that  I really wish I had just stayed  well if you can erase something from my memory then I would probably say  memory  like really if if I could erase something from my memory what would I want to erase everything  can we think of anything I mean  even like that that bad decision that I made  you know it has value in it so I can&#39;t really say that I would want something erasing maybe if I was like raped or something and it was really horrifying then I would but I don&#39;t  well if your time about being in a deep sleep I&#39;m in a deep sleep a lot but  I never feel rested and that&#39;s it&#39;s a medical problem of mine  can you tell me  well I always feel like I haven&#39;t slept for two days and  there are points in in the day  I would say during some days are points in the day where I really feel alert and alive and and rested but their short-lived  but I sleep a lot I sleep  pretty crappy physically pretty crappy  no thanks  now  I haven&#39;t been officially diagnosed with depression but  that&#39;s that&#39;s usually what doctors  like my sleeping problem hasn&#39;t been diagnosed I&#39;m I&#39;m in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but that&#39;s the first thing that they try and  figure out they they&#39;ve given me like depression drugs before but they haven&#39;t helped with my sleep  but I do  I do  I would say I feel down sometimes  my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down I would say that I do feel down sometimes a lot of time but it&#39;s not  I would say is reasonable considering the situation that I&#39;m in  okay  I need triggered by something  they&#39;re just triggered by Tech that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but  I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s triggered by anything in particular  oh there I mean  I mean for a long. Of time or every night I experience happiness like when I go out with friends or I go and you know I&#39;ve  find some great new dish I like I mean  what type of Happiness are you looking for  well  I mean right now  my friend just had surgery and so I&#39;m staying with her this week I&#39;m really enjoying it I mean even though we could never live together I can never live with live with her long-term and I&#39;m sure she couldn&#39;t live with me long term but I&#39;m having fun and  you know she just she installed the Groupon app on her on her phone yesterday cuz she&#39;s been paying too much for laser hair removal installed it on her phone and then today she&#39;s she&#39;s looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her as a Groupon deal so I mean you know there&#39;s a little fun things like that  how your best friend are you  probably  OCD  and  probably thinks I&#39;m pretty prissy compared to her  I think that she would  say that have a good heart or very different  it probably that I am  I should ask her  I know we go out so I think she say that I&#39;m fun  but she has mentioned that I&#39;m I&#39;m a very private person and that I know I&#39;ve I knew before she said that  why  I have what I told you I have I have a lot of problems right now  and  so I don&#39;t really  tell people about them  it is kind of a kind of a killjoy but also  people can feel I feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of  it&#39;s just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help her they feel guilty but they have busy lives so it&#39;s kind of traits of gaap but I would say even before even before this difficult time in my life I&#39;ve been  I put a private person I don&#39;t know why  I think a lot and I&#39;m a deep thinker  and  maybe it&#39;s a  you know it  not like I feel like I feel abnormal but maybe I just have a lot of thoughts that don&#39;t seem doesn&#39;t seem appropriate to share with people or not sure  well one thing that I regret right now is  yeah I haven&#39;t really found  somebody  you got to spend the rest of my life with so I would tell myself to concentrate more on that cuz once you hit 40 it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s a lot harder  I would say  that I persevered I&#39;m very proud that  even though I have a lot of  difficulties in my life  the fact that I&#39;m a male making this commitment to go to school and I&#39;m doing it on my own  and  you know it&#39;s  it&#39;s kind of a  if people if people knew all the problems today have they be like well you know why are you worried about school but  I really feel that  you know I&#39;m I&#39;m doing this and I&#39;m really proud that even through everything and getting a raise  okay thanks  hi
449 thank you  hi  okay  yes I am  I&#39;m good thank you  originally from Los Angeles and my parents are from Central America  yes  the weather I like that I can get to the water if I want to go to the hills or hike or just any element that want to get to I can get you  traffic busyness everybody&#39;s always in a hurry that&#39;s about it  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer  you travel a lot when I can I have family in Central America and when I can my husband and I we try to go to warm places like Mexico or somewhere in the Caribbean  the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something I said I would do if I&#39;m at home and if I&#39;m too far away from home to do it then I don&#39;t have anything to worry about  recently I went to Honduras again that&#39;s where my family is from so sore like a it&#39;s a dual fault I get to see my family but also kind of get to be away from home so I do it by not imposing on them I visit them but I stay in a hotel so that way I can still kind of have my freedom and not feel like I&#39;m obligated to being with them so it&#39;s more fun that way  experiences on vacation or  experience probably Hawaii in Lahaina and just having enough food I&#39;m a foodie so having the pig roast it on the ground and just eating it that way it&#39;s just I&#39;ve never been able to taste it that way anytime else so it&#39;s like a very memory is a deep memory for me cuz no matter what I do to my porchetta never taste like that pork in Lahaina  business and that was years ago so I ended up in the marketing field so I&#39;ve enjoyed I&#39;d my business background did help me in the marketing field  my dream job  well I guess it would have to do with food I love to cook and only reason I hesitated because I love to cook but I just do it for home and friends and family if I were to turn into in if it would have turned into a job I feel as if it was just not be as joyous or I wouldn&#39;t have as much fun as I do have it you know what I have now but if I could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that I have in cooking everyday now then that would be my dream job  I&#39;m not going  depends on where I&#39;m at if I&#39;m wherever I&#39;m at actually the first thing to do is just going to get a hold of myself that way I&#39;m always in control no matter where I&#39;m standing at and always say that I am my own piece p a p e a c e so I just kind of just take a deep breath assess my situation figure out what I can control what I can&#39;t control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kind of  breathing get a hold of myself first  I&#39;m actually very good I&#39;m actually very mild temper to begin with I don&#39;t really let anything agitate me and so if I do feel myself is getting hot or if I just react I just told her just like I said just do my own little self check you know I&#39;m not a customer went off for a second but I do my own little self check and just so you know what come on now it&#39;s not worth it this person is not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there  introducing my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and I was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kind of overlooking my feelings in it and I was I didn&#39;t want him to overlook my feelings and act as if I wasn&#39;t feeling the way I was feeling so I kept stressing my point in different ways and I found myself now in a debate and then that&#39;s when I pull back and said not look babe this is how I feel about it I&#39;m not asking you to make me feel any differently I&#39;m just asking you to acknowledge my feelings  when I got to my own conclusion I felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how I felt not for him to impose his you know he&#39;s very Macho kind of manly guy I don&#39;t want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so I said no as long as I have felt better because I eat I feel understood and I felt heard  I get my son comes to mind he&#39;s 22 years old and he we have a very strange relationship right now and it&#39;s okay I&#39;m okay with it is used to be be a little bit more needy so he I think he assumed that I would just always look cook go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting for him to call me and I think I may be a very weird answer but I wish early on in my life as his mother I would have kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn&#39;t be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn&#39;t live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know I&#39;ll try to make sure that he&#39;s okay I think it&#39;s probably way more than you met but I would have thought would have done that different I would have mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that I would have treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kind of you know  I would have to kill the expectation in him for me to Contour see him if that makes sense  I know it&#39;s not easy you have to sacrifice and Beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kids needs ahead of your own and I guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they&#39;re okay you&#39;re okay so my son and my daughter they both know I love them unconditionally so my parents and has become easier the more and more I&#39;ve lived in that true for I&#39;m not expecting anything from them but then I also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect  seeing them maybe make decisions that I wish they wouldn&#39;t make it could be as simple as an outfit no choice or as much as a career change but having to sit back and watch them listen to be open and then just kind of just be there in only want to talk about it but then not also also try not to manage them because I was also their age and have to remember that I didn&#39;t want to be managed and even if I made a mistake I don&#39;t want to be judged so the difficult part is watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kind of just waiting around and luckily something major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kind of being there and not having an I told you I told you so Spirit on me  Shuffle feeling knowing that you know I created this and all I plan both my kids so it&#39;s just it&#39;s a real it&#39;s an honor that I was able to do it as an honor that they&#39;re healthy and it&#39;s fun watching them so just kind of grow into their own and it&#39;s like they&#39;re minimis but then they&#39;re all so different than I am and so it&#39;s fun just being able to allow them be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so I&#39;m enjoying that  wow completely my parents immigrated here from Central America in the 60s I was born the year after they got here so they&#39;re their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the American lifestyle and which was not a bad thing is it that their parenting style was more about making sure we had a home making sure we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so I had to kind of figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had  divorcing my first husband cuz I was going to be the one that toppled that whole situation he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after 20 years I knew that I was going to be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since I did that the domino effect was is this is not virtual it happened we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while and then I just made some decisions to where I didn&#39;t want to go through so much Court hassle so I just did a Tina Turner and said just give you my name you keep everything else so it was a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that&#39;s all I cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff I could care less but it was hard because I I knew it was going to affect my kids and they were the only thing I was concerned about  my husband and I did not you know see eye-to-eye on certain things United regarding our marriage heat I didn&#39;t feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that&#39;s just who I am and those are the very areas that he didn&#39;t validate me and he just kind of saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extra-curricular is where there was his travel or or whatever the case maybe I&#39;m not I&#39;m not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and I was tired of just you know working and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn&#39;t prepared to change the despite all the counseling went through and I thought well this is not working for me and I have to take care of myself first and I had low self-esteem I mean I wasn&#39;t perfect I had a lot of things going on with myself and I had to learn how to love myself and I were to die in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the dog that I should get in return  how is your day  you know what is actually pretty easy because of the end of the day I just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes I&#39;m happy that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when I put my head down at night I just ask myself didn&#39;t you know that I do anything but I&#39;m ashamed of today that I cross anybody that I not do you know and I&#39;m not being a Pollyanna but I believe in karma I&#39;m a God-fearing woman so I just want to make sure that I did everything I&#39;m supposed to do today and if there&#39;s something I can Rectify it you know I just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectified or at least learn from that and just not make the same mistake in another day  really good light you don&#39;t have to rough patches with the family individually like I said with my son my daughter the teenagers so she&#39;s kind of coming into her own so that&#39;s a different relationship to the opposite of me I&#39;m actually very easy going very Bohemian style she&#39;s very social very it&#39;ll just out there so I&#39;m having to just kind of find our balance but overall it&#39;s just I won&#39;t complain I&#39;m very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that I just kind of foster on my own every day and I just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not  no I haven&#39;t thanked God  no  really happy to see  that&#39;s at home and I think it was when  different things running through my head  I think with my daughter and I my teenage daughter and I came to understand understanding on our mother daughter relationship I&#39;m not trying to be her best friend but yet doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t talk to me and I think when she came to me the other day just going to give me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything I really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that I accept who she is as she is so it was a very same moment I only see and I kind of knew about it but it just gave me just a happiness it nothing else could ever give me  thank you  I&#39;m easy going I&#39;m fine I&#39;m just very you know a chameleon comes to mind I just kind of acclimate to It Whatever situation I&#39;m in I&#39;m very honest I&#39;m very real and just you know old if I have to be I&#39;m just very adult I&#39;m an adult woman and you know they were just described my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable I do as I say I say what I do and I just you know I don&#39;t I don&#39;t deal with BF  how to change about myself probably cosmetic things maybe I would just sounds weird that I was saying nothing nothing really  I think I would just be a little bit more aware of others I think I&#39;m super sensitive to others but I think I would just be more aware make sure that I&#39;m not being selfish or I&#39;m not turning anyone out just because I want to get through my yoga I want to do something else I think I would just be more observant and aware of those around me to make sure I&#39;m not offending anybody  I don&#39;t have any regrets that I think about that all the time and you know this is natural to go back and say if I were in that situation with the mindset I have now what would I do it but the reality is that I know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so I can&#39;t you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because I know I learned from it probably sounds very textbook but that&#39;s true that&#39;s is really how I live so I believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happen for a reason I truly believe that and my job is to take from it what I&#39;m supposed to take from it and take that into my future so I&#39;m to take the you know the Hard Knocks with it with the joys  be real with myself that&#39;s that&#39;s one thing that took me 20 years to kind of get to just to kind of be honest with myself to embrace who I am to just you don&#39;t get to know who I am learn my own infrastructure be comfortable with the with the innate things that are a part of me don&#39;t try to read. I read that myself or try to become something that I&#39;m not I would have still chosen the same marketing career to see if I would have still climb the same corporate ladders but I would have done it from a more internal place not that I lost myself in it but when in terms of my family life I would have just been more true to myself and that way I would have had any kind of resentments  my family my my role as a wife my role as a mother I think that ultimately that&#39;s where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this life this life of in this body and this vehicle. I mean I&#39;m going to do or I&#39;m going to be as an Epitaph and somewhere in a cemetery  and I&#39;m always just true to that I mean I&#39;ve been always true to that from the time I Was Eighteen and realize I wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that I think that ultimately that that&#39;s where my true fulfillment comes from  thank you  bye  that&#39;s cool that&#39;s cool  okie dokie

Near holiday  I felt absolutely fantastic I felt happy I felt relaxed I felt like I didn&#39;t have a care in the world to temporarily free  what are some things you wish you could change about you  I wish I could be a little bit stronger and more assertive  definitely more assertive  I would say I&#39;m a wonderful wonderful friend when I left somebody you know I love them very deeply friends family  boyfriend so I think that&#39;s good I&#39;m very loyal as a friend I&#39;m honest I care about people I&#39;m fun to be with so I think those are some of my best qualities  my relationship with my family with my father is not so great my parents were divorced when I was young and he&#39;s sort of been in and out of my life you know forever mostly out so that it&#39;s not fantastic but but it&#39;s something that I&#39;m used to so it&#39;s not as painful as it would be a Patty been there and then I lost him but it&#39;s it&#39;s still it&#39;s still it&#39;s still not the best situation I mean I still wish that could be remedied some  there&#39;s good and bad relationships in my family  who&#39;s some of the positive influence in your life  someone that&#39;s been there for me since I was very very young and is always been just incredible when I love her so much  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  10 or 20 years ago I would have told myself to work harder than and not have so much fun so I don&#39;t have to work so hard now  a guy regret exactly that I regret I&#39;m not taking my career seriously earlier on because now it&#39;s been it&#39;s been much harder  tell me about something you did read  I think it was taking the kids to the pier and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy that was probably a great time I&#39;m one of the best times in the last few weeks  and and they&#39;re they&#39;re great kids  you find it easy to be a parent  no I think they&#39;re there it&#39;s challenging it is more difficult because their stepchildren so there are some times when I&#39;m not sure exactly how much to get involved and how much not to get involved but we&#39;re very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot but  but I but it&#39;s not as difficult as I think some other parents have it  what are some ways that your  and your pet  I made it make a make a conscious effort not to not to punish them or over punish them I make a conscious decision not to scream at them the way that I was scream. I was screaming a lot as a child and it was really it was really difficult so I make sure not to do that  what are you most proud of in your life  I think I&#39;m most proud of the fact that I have been able to travel the world  and live in other places many many other places around the country and around the world and the fact that I learned several languages  and that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been able to maintain really long long long relationships with my friends  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you  goodbye  post survey for you to fill out
466 I was that man  when do I talk okay okay  okay  yeah that okay okay it&#39;s better okay thanks  okay thank you thank you  yes  okay  Los Angeles  the weather  the variety of environments the ocean you know various different environment or environmental variety  I don&#39;t like the superficiality of people the narcissistic attitude  just the  it doesn&#39;t have a small-town sort of feel where you know just the warm the human sort of warms the interactively so yeah  no  am I have a fear of flying and I have developed agoraphobia  incredibly difficult  I&#39;m guessing you mean the agoraphobia more so than the fear of flying it&#39;s it&#39;s more of a recent development and  it&#39;s it&#39;s pregret it&#39;s progressing to be worse it&#39;s very what&#39;s the word immobilizing and very distressing actually  yes it is  how do I cope with that  just  just trying to do the best I can and try to you know have the most courage I can in the situation and challenge myself and small steps I read a lot I do I&#39;m bibliotherapy reading and I try to inform myself of the of the professional literature I&#39;m so that I could hopefully over comment someday  yes definitely  certain things trigger at like enclosed spaces being in a car traveling being away from home being in someone else&#39;s car things that are outside of my locus of control  add actually I don&#39;t go to school right now  my dream job is  to be a psychologist  I&#39;m not a psychologist but what would make me decide to do that is  having lived through some challenges like this having lived through some traumas but I&#39;ve always had an interest in it since junior high of I&#39;m very interested in people and Men human interaction and human connection and the betterment of of of those things bridging people together and helping people interpersonally through their child personal challenges so that&#39;s that&#39;s sort of in a nutshell  I think I&#39;m someone who&#39;s  I can be very outgoing and sort of a warm and friendly presents very easily but I think on the exterior but I think I&#39;m shy and I challenged it to do that  I think it hard I&#39;m shy but I but I challenge myself completely cuz I do love human interaction so I take those risks and and jump and those challenges  the last time I interacted with somebody was today  if I think I&#39;m understanding your question correctly  oh no I think I misunderstand your question but I I interacted with Rachel I just I&#39;m continuously interacting with people  take taking those risks  a very good  very good  I just left them argued with somebody  actually can&#39;t remember it wasn&#39;t recent  I have to think about that I don&#39;t know yet let me think  I&#39;m drawing a blank I can only remember things  from what I was like 21 right now I can&#39;t think of anything contemporary right right now my mind is  okay I when I was younger  can you tell me about that yes I lost a relationship with my aunt and my uncle and my cousin&#39;s cuz when I was 21 on 45 I  I had a disagreement with my aunt and I said something that was a critical of her and she threw me out of their home and  let me back I apologized immediately and they let me back into their lives and change their minds so  I regret that  I&#39;m assuming you mean how do I feel when they asked me to never I&#39;ll be in their lives again and to leave shattered Soul shattered heart shattered  tell me about  well that that was my family that was the good side of my family there&#39;s  the majority of my fat they were they were the the loving aspect of my family on the rest of my family is very cruel and very abusive  I&#39;m I don&#39;t have any relationship with my family at all like there since I was 21 since my aunt and uncle  disown me I guess it&#39;s the right word estranged yeah  gosh I&#39;m drawing a blank just bear with me for one second something I could erase  I can&#39;t even get it to my memory  as an example  I was injured and I wish I could get that away from my memory  yeah I was injured in the emergency room  doing I went in for food poisoning I was ordered to go in by a doctor I had collapsed and I was ordered to go into the ER for that I said food poisoning and I came out injured with a neurological syndrome I was injured with a  what do you call it  intravenous procedure and now I have RSD reflex sympathetic dystrophy and the scene in the emergency room was it was an out-of-control saying there was a problem with the procedure and the doctor was yelling at his staff who made a mistake and it was extremely excruciating it was a crisis and so every time I think about the injury and it was disfigured I got disabled got disabled for disabled permanently from it was also a disabled from my employment for a quite amount of a given amount of time as well and and it I have residual physical Trauma from it and disfigurement and  severe disability disability limited functionality with my right my I&#39;m right-handed my right hand and arm thank you  tell me about the hardest decisions  I don&#39;t even know what that is  you know I I really I apologize cuz I can&#39;t really probably give you the most suitable answer  I&#39;m guessing it has something to do with my cat and her her urgent  what do you call it  I heard she was in intensive care veterinary care and I&#39;m sure it had something to do with that  but other than that I would say I had Choosing My Life Path weather  and I was admitted to that program or whether I was going to go to art school for four years and I had to pick a life Direction but that&#39;s not a traumatic situation  so I don&#39;t know how best to answer your question  I can&#39;t  I have severe nightmares and I have nocturnal panic attacks  are you triggered by something and I also have physical illness on top of it and I&#39;m in excruciating pain  you have disturbing thoughts  yes  yes  yes they&#39;re triggered by the injury that I told you they&#39;re triggered by my family  how they&#39;ve treated me what they said to me what they&#39;ve done to me they&#39;re triggered by what else my my physical illness not my injury Olney but my physical illness as well so yes  I feel very ill  and feel so fatigued  very ill and very fatigued  when I don&#39;t sleep and get enough sleep at my anxiety level I believe is up and I&#39;m susceptible to feeling distressed so yeah  yes  3 years ago my most recent diagnosis and in 2001 as well  oh yes  3 years ago and  when I was  20 years old  the my background my childhood from my family of origin and there are the abuse that I went through and their ultimate what&#39;s the word  rejection of me and estrangement that was the first reason  no I stopped 6 months ago  why did I stop I&#39;m just taking a break I&#39;m going to continue  yes very much  it&#39;s helped tremendously  I think it helps with anxiety at helps with  it helps Inspire crate inspiration that helps feeling connected it helps to create what I ultimately my goal is to give myself a voice and it helps to to side is part of that process it also helps to understand myself to learn about myself  and there&#39;s just so many benefits it&#39;s  I&#39;ll stop right there and there&#39;s many more  the last time I felt really happy is it was a really long time ago it was before my illness and it was in 1997 on the outside of my illness was in July of 97 so it was before that  yes I was in a very good place in terms of my career in terms of my just my relationships and everything was just sort of at its best career relationships personal fulfillment start of as well I was very active and and doing a very many things that were made in full to build a life thumb and I was in the process of  just in the in the planning stages of my life but also very accomplished at the same time so it&#39;s just that they were just going very well and I was just really liked just where my life was at it was just in a really good place and many ways  I wish I could change about myself my anxiety I wish I could change about myself my agoraphobia my PTSD meeting my trauma and what else  my insecurities as far as just  with other people in the sense that I&#39;m always trying to make sure that that I don&#39;t do something that that hold on one second I&#39;m just trying to make sure that I don&#39;t do anything that&#39;s offensive to them or insults them or is disrespectful and I I feel like I&#39;m overly cautious about that and it kind of becomes an anxiety unto itself so I I definitely think that would be beneficial to change the other thing I&#39;d like to change about myself and I wish I could feel and also depression I&#39;d like to change about myself I wish I could feel better I wish I didn&#39;t feel so tired of the burden that I do love my family I&#39;m not having one  and what else I wish I didn&#39;t have my illness and the physical excruciating pain that I&#39;m in so those are some things and I also wish that and this is a byproduct of PTSD I wish that I didn&#39;t have the the symptom ology of PTI say is that definitely affects one&#39;s complete complete life like her life completely and I wish I was more articulate and I wish I was someone who was well-spoken and someone was well-written but there&#39;s many there&#39;s many more things that I wish I could change about myself to improve myself so many more  I&#39;m not sure  maybe to not be so trusting I trusted  I trusted some medical professionals that  you know again created the injury and it a word  there&#39;s a what&#39;s the word there&#39;s an expectation and it sort of a demand to just blindly trust the medical profession and don&#39;t ask questions or just sort of you know and if not to trust your own self your own your own instincts or intuition and so I would I would have told myself to be a little more careful I guess if that&#39;s useful to your question  what did I really enjoy  and I can&#39;t think of anything specific  but  I know it would have to do  with either reading or connecting with someone on a meaningful level  I&#39;m most proud of  my compassion  my my empathy and caring about people despite I mean I&#39;m proud of it anyways but I&#39;m also particularly am I come from an environment that&#39;s the opposite on the background and then the wasn&#39;t taught that but I really do care about people and  I&#39;m I guess I&#39;m most proud of that I&#39;m also proud of my career accomplishments and my tenacity my my Fierce tenacity to succeed and  you know just also to get the strength it takes to get through the injury to live with it and to live with the illness that I live at the physical illness so I think that would be it  yes  okay  you&#39;re welcome  bye  okay I&#39;ve been crying and opening up to this person so I think I did but what you&#39;re what you wanted right I&#39;m embarrassed cuz I got really sort of involved like she was asking questions that you know we&#39;re really at the heart of you know some of your pay and you know and I was honest about it so the video is like oh my God she don&#39;t like this person like that I&#39;m sure this is what you were hoping that someone genuinely interact right with someone okay cool  okay okay oh thank you yeah I didn&#39;t know I&#39;d
481 can&#39;t you see me right now  okay  hello  yeah I am  good to moderate  Los Angeles  yeah I&#39;m from  just a lot of different kinds of people and I love the weather most of the time and great creative seeing I&#39;m really into music so it&#39;s a great scene for that  I don&#39;t like driving I don&#39;t know who does right it&#39;s just it&#39;s just such a drag and getting from point A to point B is just the daily need and it doesn&#39;t get any easier too many people too many people  can&#39;t see your shoes  yeah when I can I want when I can afford to  being somewhere else not having to drive usually must places have better public transportation just mean I&#39;m a culture junkie I like experiencing different types of cultures so that&#39;s  how many places I&#39;ve been to like Mexico and Italy it it&#39;s I want to go to more places I want to go to Japan  so that&#39;ll be interesting and usually this is my family my mom sometimes my girlfriend sometimes my brother and we just yeah we go to Italy we spent two weeks there though I was cool  yeah  living next to the best gelato shop in Italy  we were we were in Florence spent a spend a week in Florence that was great big very good culture there as well  art  studied film and digital media cuz I make music and I want to learn how to make music videos so it&#39;s someone trying to get into  yeah yeah I mean I need to get a camera that&#39;s the thing but I&#39;ve been with my main focus is music I studied film but my focus is music  can you tell me about  sure I&#39;ve been playing music and playing guitar keyboard bass drums for about 12 years now and I do production and songwriting an indie rock band  that&#39;s a great website I highly recommend it and it&#39;s it&#39;s mine so  Shake It Up  International Rockstar music producer and filmmaker director  probably are going  I&#39;m just feel like it&#39;s the way to get the most out of life talking to people and learning about them and having them learn about you and care about you it&#39;s a territory  yeah  I do meditation  and  it&#39;s not really hard cuz it&#39;s fun and it it relaxes me and helps me Focus the same time  which I know that that was a huge Epiphany for me that you can relax and focus at the same time cuz they&#39;re only when I&#39;m relaxing I&#39;m tuning out I&#39;m focusing on something else but to be able to come by in the sensations was yeah I&#39;ve been doing that for about 3 months now so  yeah it is  almost to get a tax sometimes others things that should be said that I that I don&#39;t just because you know it&#39;s like you&#39;re opening up a can of worms maybe one of your friends for example I got a problem with him but they don&#39;t have a problem with him necessarily so you can do anything to them and I&#39;ve had to deal with that in the past sort of a awkward social situation but  yeah I make deal  probably argued with the guitarist for my band we had a falling-out we&#39;re not going to be in a band together and we&#39;re still friends so at least it&#39;s that but it was just basically about creative control the project and how we&#39;re going to prioritize it and in our lives and  you know we just our priorities weren&#39;t the same and I got very upset so that was the end of that  I felt good that it was definitive that it was no choice has been made on both parties also regretful that you know he didn&#39;t feel the way that I want him to feel about it which was excited about the project so  the fact that he wasn&#39;t really in it kind of pissed me off but I got over it any I got some other people that are really really excited to be working with me even honored so you know I&#39;m gone  thank you  I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t really I don&#39;t really have any regrets like that at the moment I can&#39;t really think of any  when I was in high school I cheated on my girlfriend I don&#39;t think it would mean anything it&#39;s time  but I did it  I regret it but I  you know you know life happens you make some mistakes  selfishness  being young and thinking it would matter  you know  thinking  you know you only live once and  you know for me it&#39;s probably for the best ultimately cuz you know I love my current girlfriend and I would never do that to her so  that was that was years ago but and she was a nice girl she didn&#39;t deserve that so  I got it  shit genzyme  I guess whether to go to college or not cuz I had some projects going in La that I didn&#39;t really want to shut off a dab and going get a manager we were playing out a lot and I wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted to keep that going or go to school and start over and I made the decision to go to school in Santa Cruz and and start a new life there for four years and  it was difficult decision but I&#39;m glad I did send that a lot of people a lot of people I&#39;m still close with today that and we work on stuff together and all that so good  I agree that is good thank you  maybe I wish I could forget getting spanked in the parking lot when I was 4 by Danish babysitter you know on the abuse scale it&#39;s pretty low but it was somewhat humiliating and I I don&#39;t forget so  have a pretty vivid picture of it and  I&#39;d be happier if it wasn&#39;t there  positive there a sportive give me a hard time sometimes because they don&#39;t think that I keep things in perspective and terms of, to support myself even though I do it&#39;s just so you know I have a more long-range picture than they do and I have faith in myself and  creative projects that I make so  yeah there&#39;s a bit of tension there just cuz they expect certain things from me and I expect them as well but I just have a different way of going about it than they might prefer  but they&#39;re sweet people  how do I cope with them I do know what they&#39;re lovely people at their core you know cope with them cuz I love them I just  no X I&#39;ll just go off on my own for a while  and you know take a breather or whatever and they have everyone makes you mad sometimes so  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  challenging  I just I try doesn&#39;t work  sometimes I have to take medication for it at to take Ambien something like that  I&#39;m someone who sleeps in late so I always get at least six or seven hours if I have to wake up early for something I get nauseous sometimes I&#39;ll throw up in the morning yeah I&#39;ve had jobs where I wake up and  you know vomit while I&#39;m brushing my teeth it&#39;s horrible  it does suck its kind of something I&#39;m worried about you know I kind of need to get some part-time work while I&#39;m not you know getting a steady payflow for my music production so  yeah it&#39;s pretty rough  got some stuff I need to get over I&#39;m not really sure how  just not feeling good getting nervous when you know there&#39;s something stressful like a stressful work environment or just something that it doesn&#39;t sit well with me like being in a  yeah I rushed and you know stressful work environment just unless it&#39;s about something that I care about you no like music or the Arts it&#39;s just very hard to give a shit frankly like and you know I try to psych myself into giving a shit and it just makes me sick you know maybe I&#39;ll have a Red Bull or something and your body doesn&#39;t want that in the morning it just like my body rejects things and  yeah  okay  I&#39;ve been feeling okay  very very reflective for contemplative now there&#39;s going to be some changes and it&#39;s going to be  some new people in my life some new people in my band and I&#39;m going to try to push myself but try to stay grounded at the same time cuz you know I expect more for myself it&#39;s just pissing me off when I get mad at me. Basically feel like I&#39;m shiting all over myself my body sitting on me anyway just by being so so  shity  yeah  no  yes  I was diagnosed  12 years ago I haven&#39;t been in therapy since  they gave me Zoloft and I don&#39;t like it  made me feel worse than I do in the shittiest moments I was telling you about it it made me feel numb  I don&#39;t want to feel numb I want to feel everything even if it sucks  being forced to  this private school they thought I was acting up I thought I was up at a kid I think I was just being a kid so  yes I do  well I haven&#39;t been in in 12 years but I do think that it might be helpful for me in the future  can you tell me about that  I thought you weren&#39;t a therapist that&#39;s a typical therapist question right there  well yeah  I kind of want to go back to therapy and might help might help me buy some solutions maybe maybe it&#39;s not a therapist any maybe it&#39;s a life coach I have no idea but  I&#39;ll be seeking help soon  yesterday  I was watching a movie with my girlfriend and I looked over at her and smiled at each other and it was great  yeah  very honest  sometimes brutally so but I&#39;m a good guy I think they&#39;re my friends all think I&#39;m a gay guy funny  open minded  I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m working on which is trying to improve my discipline and try to work through  my body rejecting shittiness of the world  it gets better  stay in shape gets harder the longer you wait  give up on your dreams keep doing what you&#39;re doing  my music  you&#39;re welcome miss talking to you
609 research experience  actually going to see a virtual human here for a second  got it  but I told Claudia was going to send her an email or having I&#39;m bringing the  mawamba Children&#39;s Choir

turn up the volume just a bit  can you turn up the volume just a bit  find thank you  where are you from originally Boston Massachusetts  things you really like about a leg  people first and foremost I&#39;m very involved with the veteran community and I&#39;m a chaplain answering my 52nd year  things you don&#39;t really like  traffic but that&#39;s true anywhere  I see what you mean  do you experience do you experience virtual traffic  what do you enjoy about traveling  the experience is the food the culture travel to 44 countries in my career  I&#39;d like to hear that one of your trips  I was stationed in Paris France  and travel to France Spain Morocco live in Germany is part of my chaplaincy service it was unbelievably exciting  visiting SEC liqueur in that my Mart in Paris on my first day in France in Europe  I graduated with a degree in Psychology from Boston College  what do you do now I&#39;m retired but I&#39;m still very active as a volunteer at the prison in Chino women&#39;s prison and I can deck services at  Jewish community that I stablished 51 + years ago  what&#39;s your dream job  actually I&#39;ve been living my dream job since I was 17 years old serving in the chaplain city as a Jewish chaplain is what I wanted to do from the time I was early five or six years old I want to become a rabbi  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing quite outgoing  why because I&#39;m able to be dropped into a room of 500 or a thousand total strangers and get to know them and have them get to know me without discomfort  I&#39;m divorced I was married for 16 years I have a daughter  my she&#39;s been there at the light of my life my entire life I have a brother and sister-in-law and living back in Boston my parents are deceased  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  I actually have a fish tank and aquarium and instead of turning it on and seeing Virtual Fish shine watch the real thing  I also like to go fishing deep-sea fishing  I&#39;m able to do that quite well  when was the last time you argue with someone  I would say it was a several months ago and it was about language  dating someone and I thought her language was inappropriate and at first I thought I would say nothing and then I decided I should tell her what I was thinking and so I did  that you wish you would handle differently  the last time I saw my former wife she has created some legal problems for me and  I was not as polite as I might have been  I felt she was totally wrong and out of line it&#39;s been a very difficult and acrimonious divorce took 13 years to resolve  that I in the last few years have not spent as much time with my daughter I was quite ill and ended up having open heart surgery and that was time when really she was abandoned I was always there to be buffer between my former wife and my daughter and when I was suddenly taken ill took me about two years to really become healthy again and during those two years she had to fend for herself from the ages of 15 to 17 difficult time for a daughter to be on her own with the mother who  not as as nurturing as one would like  that was the hardest decision ironically was going to do I have the surgery now and try to save my life knowing that I would be abandoning my daughter abandoning in the Lesser sense of the word we were still in contact but I couldn&#39;t be there to run interference for her or put it off and maybe suffered the consequences so I I made the decision to have the surgery  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  the only real negatives in my life have been in connection with the divorce I never thought I would be divorced I always wanted to be married and have four children and the white picket fence now I got married and I had a child and had the white picket fence actually built it  but that was the toughest thing for me  adjusting to divorce I never thought it would have I nobody in my family on either side has ever been divorced  yes I was in the air force during Vietnam War  how old were you when you join the military  17 I was going to go to Hebrew Union college-jewish Seminary in Cincinnati Ohio the war was raging in Vietnam and there was a need for chaplains and I was asked if I would serve and so I did and I originally thought it would be two years and then it was three and it was a four and then they had more time shows for years and two months I don&#39;t regret a day of it  unfortunately I served in Europe not in Vietnam I was never shot at I never had to kill anybody but I really enjoyed my military service  why&#39;d you decide to enlist in the military  why do they say to do what  why do they say to go in  yes going into the military was an opportunity for me to travel the world and do what I love doing and I&#39;ve continued doing it for the rest of my adult life  did you ever see combat never not a day  but it was the luck of the draw when you put on the uniform you go where the government send you I could have just as easily been shipped off to Vietnam about 55 of the 60 people with who like trained went to Vietnam and fewer than 50 returned  very high mortality  I&#39;m sorry to hear that  how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life  very easy because of the type of service I had it was as close to Miller cech&#39;s civilian life is one cat have  started a business ran the business and while I continued as a volunteer chaplain and I&#39;ve been doing that I still do it to this day  alright I&#39;m 68  it didn&#39;t change me as much as it allowed me I guess it did change me at a lot of Peter broaden my horizons here I was coming from Boston basically a kid and I find myself traveling the world and in a very responsible position conducting religious services and teaching and working with other chaplains of other faiths a lot of interfaith work in the military  marvelous experience I don&#39;t know anyone else who&#39;s ever done it quite the way I&#39;ve done it  I hold the record in Europe for on Passover we had 16 Passover seder is in 8 days in five countries  why are you sorry  how you been feeling lately Dracut  tell me more about that  I got a feeling good I&#39;ve been very fortunate since having open heart surgery I&#39;ve been relatively healthy and I&#39;m very involved in the community and I enjoy every every aspect of that sometimes it&#39;s very tiring but it&#39;s a good tired  have you noticed any changes in her behavior or softly I don&#39;t understand have I ever done what  how easy is it for you to get a good night&#39;s sleep very easy I usually retire about 11:30 12:00 at night and sleep through for 6 to 7 hours  and it&#39;s usually as a result of being ill if I have the flu or cold or whatever then I&#39;m sluggish the next day or for two days but I&#39;m usually able to bounce back  no I&#39;ve not fortunately  I&#39;ve never been diagnosed with PTSD  I&#39;ve never been diagnosed with PTSD  you&#39;re asking me questions that I&#39;ve already answered that I&#39;ve not been diagnosed with PTSD so they&#39;re not triggered since they don&#39;t exist  can you tell me about that  I just did  turn of the frustrations of dealing with it a virtual person is your pre-program just so you&#39;re not asking the right question  tell me more about that  what is your next question  you feel therapy is useful I think it is for some people yes probably for most  tell me more about that  I think it&#39;s a very useful tool and many people have been successful in receiving therapy  many of the veterans with whom I live in work I have had extensive therapy and it&#39;s proven to be very successful  changes have you noticed  I haven&#39;t been going to therapy so there haven&#39;t been changes  all right  when was the last time you felt really happy  yesterday  went to a birthday party there somebody 85 years old and there was a great great granddaughter who were just celebrating her first birthday  it was a fun day  yes it was  old number of people  a number of rabbis and

372 okay and please  are you okay with  Des  come  pretty good kind of  Los Angeles  the thing I like about ale the weather  what are some things you don&#39;t really  it&#39;s not easy to meet people  can you tell me about  well it just feels like people aren&#39;t out very much they&#39;re like that movie in Crash where people are just in their cars all the time it feels like that  no  not too much  child development  well I have a son and I wanted to know how to be a good mom and so I wanted to know about the stages that he would be going through and be able to relate better to him  are you happy  I am  kind of I&#39;m trying to get it started again in the fall  I love my job you could almost say it&#39;s virtually made for me  I like the right  tell me about that  I&#39;ve written some children&#39;s books and I&#39;ve just been doing research looking and so getting my books published it&#39;s only like two that I&#39;ve written so far but they&#39;re pretty good I got some good feedback on them for my critique groups  it&#39;s about  a little boy that surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with him and if it&#39;s a bit like a really  he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life  you find it easy to be a parent  I know I have had some issues with nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so I know I was single mom it was the hardest thing I think in the world  so  how do I cope  all right now  I didn&#39;t have very many coping skills are mechanisms so  that was the problem  it&#39;s so spontaneous  make the stuff that comes out of kids mouth sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face  well when I said was younger  once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me Mom I want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend  so  yeah pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kids telling me I need to not be single anymore  okay  the hardest thing  not wanting to screw it up  have a lot of stress and pressure  that  every little thing is going to be in make a difference in matter  and what kind of person like it turns out to be  and  so  it&#39;s a lot of stress on yourself  yeah  yeah definitely  I think  I&#39;m different from my mom  because I&#39;m a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction I welcome it you know I welcome  getting to know who my child is right now and  not try to mold them into somebody that I want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person  say it again  who someone that&#39;s a positive influence  I don&#39;t really have anybody  like that  what I&#39;m feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  hey I know it&#39;s not a lie but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  what do you do to relax  well  I&#39;ve tried to meditate sometimes but I don&#39;t really stick with it often enough  I&#39;ve tried to like go for walks but I don&#39;t always do that and I will always stick with it  so  that&#39;s about it  I say  I&#39;m a little below average meaning that I get angry more than most people do I think  when was the  last night it was on the telephone I was arguing with my husband we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment I should say and she&#39;s got four people living in one room so  it&#39;s kind of stressful it&#39;s really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know I&#39;m just saying to him that I told you so I told you if my sister moved in here  they said there was going to be a mess in the house and she&#39;s going to be asking for things you don&#39;t really want to do that&#39;s just how my sister is so the house is messy and it&#39;s crowded and everyday they&#39;re asking for brides and my husband he&#39;s avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn&#39;t want to be there anymore and I just saying that he&#39;s going to have to find a way to deal with it because  he asked for it in my opinion  where does  oh I got time to Bumble right now  but now my mind is losing custody of my son right now like I&#39;ve been arguing with my stepmom and my step-sister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how I want them to be treated like they don&#39;t have any boundaries  and I believe that boundaries are important in establishing who&#39;s the adult who&#39;s the child they let my child boss them around and stuff anyways because of this they&#39;re going to be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that  yeah there any saying that I&#39;m not a good mom because I believe in having boundaries and we had very different ideas about child-raising she&#39;s my stepmom she&#39;s my dad&#39;s death wife  and she&#39;s  she really does it she&#39;s really far removed from how I was raised and I want to raise my child more similar to how I was raised where you we had some independent that we had some boundaries that we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us  where&#39;s my stepmom she invents no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that&#39;s fine with your grandparents but the problem is that I live with him sometimes and when I&#39;m in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not  trying to go and break all of my rules  anyway  yam  in that moment  just really frustrated because they don&#39;t listen to me  I fell  disrespected I feel like invisible I feel  just angry  that they&#39;re taking away my right to pair it and it&#39;s something that I worked really hard to do I went to school and I study Child Development I read all the magazines and I read the books and I really  I know what I&#39;m talkin about I feel confident and my parenting skills in my parenting abilities and they have these people that have it done the same thing I worked as hard as I have to be a good parent try and tell me that I&#39;m a bad parent  it&#39;s really  hard to believe so I feel very disrespected and acknowledge angry frustrated  all those things  I take I take Benadryl to help me sleep  and I&#39;m so  my doctor gave me that give you Benadryl told me I can take it to help me sleep  last night I was crying  before I went to sleep  so what time do you start start running through your head at night when you&#39;re in bed  but I tried to push them out and then I got up and I took my Benadryl so I can go to sleep more easily  I need triggered by something  yeah I&#39;m always thinking about my son  I wish you was with me  and how unfair everything is it&#39;s happening  I like I don&#39;t deserve  do you have my son taken from me because I&#39;m a really good mom you know  and I&#39;m too hard on myself so  but I am a good mom and I feel confident that I&#39;m a good mom or Jess  I don&#39;t really have the money to take care of my son like my dad to send dad does he has more money than me  and right now I&#39;m trying to be okay with it because  I know he can do more for him  financially than I could  that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not a good mom  I&#39;m pretty depressed I&#39;m on antidepressants  take Wellbutrin I&#39;ve been on it for a couple weeks now  I think they&#39;re working I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not as  down as I was I mean I got here today I got dressed and I&#39;m here today so...  my husband complains a lot he says  I&#39;m not the same person  that I was when he married me  he said it was fun and I was positive and  I was all these other optimistic things that&#39;s another thing is on the phone telling you last night and  and  I&#39;m not those things anymore which is true I mean we got married a year ago  and that my son was taken shortly after and it was just such  a shock  and  I&#39;ve just been trying to get back from it  but it&#39;s been hard  did I think I had a problem before I found out  found out what  oh  yeah I like crying a lot sometimes I cry all the time  play  my family would invite me to family events  and I would go and just just cry because my son wasn&#39;t there  toram  I don&#39;t know  it&#39;s just all the crying I think and like I said my husband letting me know that I&#39;m not the same person  so  he&#39;s disappointed that I feel bad even that I&#39;m not the same person that he knew I feel bad about that to another thing I&#39;m feeling bad about you know  you still go to therapy now  yes I do I try  I feel like the therapist useful  yeah it&#39;s nice to talk about your problems I go in there and I cry every week so I need to have a set time every week where I can go in and cry  that&#39;s I mean it&#39;s a release to be able to cry sometimes I feel better afterwards  yeah  and she helps me make decisions you know  help me to be more proactive in my life  well I&#39;m looking for  jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don&#39;t you work here why don&#39;t you work there have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about how did you go back to school at so I went and applied to go back to school you know I&#39;m not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn&#39;t helping my depression any either  so I&#39;m trying to find a work and I applied for college  in the fall I got accepted to Dominguez Hills  so I may be going back to school in the fall right now I&#39;m still looking for work but she helps me with that kind of stuff just giving me ideas  that life isn&#39;t over there still more you know I could be doing this like like yeah  everything&#39;s always bittersweet  I don&#39;t know  last time it was really happy  I don&#39;t know  my ideal weekend  oh  I don&#39;t have a lot of money cuz I&#39;m not working right now so really my weekends are just fed  reading maybe that I can&#39;t believe I can&#39;t pay much attention when I&#39;m reading have a short attention span I can only read a couple of chapters  but lately I say that&#39;s what I&#39;ve been doing is reading  something I read  okay  I need to go to USC they have

I grew up in Sacramento actually I didn&#39;t get to tell you I was born in Bakersfield and I lived here anyways I don&#39;t know if I did I forgot anyways yeah there&#39;s like nothing really to do there it&#39;s really small as to Valley La has all the stuff to do has oceans and his file kinds of located on by a lot of cool places like Vegas and San Diego and what have you not but yeah other than that I miss my friends and stuff that I don&#39;t miss like actual City I just missed some of the people that I grew up with  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I can&#39;t see your shoes but I don&#39;t travel after I&#39;ve only been out of California like six time so I would like to travel inside  have enough money to do so  I want to be a filmmaker and which I still want to be a filmmaker and I said I was 10 I took Communications and the general that stuff too and took my video production classes and did a lot of stuff in regards to I&#39;m filmmaking and I have learned a lot of stuff and I still have that knowledge however I haven&#39;t really used it since I&#39;ve been back here in La I did all that stuff in Northern California in Sacramento but and then I transfer switch over to be at the business which I took some classes in that but now I&#39;m actually studying to be an optician and I&#39;m actually almost done with schooling and getting ready to try to get infield and become an optician so  but I do want to be I still want to be a filmmaker and I&#39;m that still one of my plans and I still actually I got into I&#39;m playing poker 2 years ago and I really like the idea of becoming a full-time filmmaker or full-time poker player have it both of those jobs are extremely difficult to make a living out of it have to be like a small percent so we&#39;ll see if not then hopefully my optician career could take me somewhere  3 oxygen  I guess I was just trying to find something that it was like it it&#39;s like a trade it supposed to private college but it just like specifically trained you into one feel then you just learned that you don&#39;t do like your GED and all these other classes like you normally do for like like a major or whatever you&#39;re going to do so it just trains you to civically to be auditioning and jump in the field I took it just because I actually want to be a dental assistant sound like something maybe I could do it sounds interesting but then the counselor actually got my attention to be optician so I&#39;m now trying to be an optician and it&#39;s interesting so it&#39;s fine it&#39;s really hard but it&#39;s interesting in it and it and it&#39;s it&#39;s fine  we want to benefit this far as like being able to help people see better and feel comfortable with glasses or contact lenses whatever they feel welcome for what  I&#39;m definitely outgoing however I can be shy sometimes like I&#39;m kind of shy right now because talking to you and your computer and your cartoon or animated or whatever but no usually 98%  I turn on the  hey  but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  I actually was actually kind of funny and I think maybe this might go further some of the poker players to really I&#39;ve never really talked to any professional poker player to be as far as like I actually playing poker is actually something that helps me forget about anything as far as like  stuff in the past or present or future stuff is coming up as far as like I am really would I really do not think about anything and just think about poker and it actually it&#39;s kind of like a therapy thing for me cuz I don&#39;t like I guess you could say the kind of drug because I don&#39;t think about anything as far as like stressed out or depressed our stuff that&#39;s happened in the past I just like focus on poker so it&#39;s actually kind of relieved and however playing poker is very stressful on top of that so I guess it&#39;s kind of like a catch-22 or whatever but yeah so no poker I put like to play basketball I like to watch movies I can go to the beach actually one of the things I like to do is go to the beach cuz it does it makes me feel good but I usually when you go to the beach when it&#39;s hot. During the cold season so it&#39;s coming up soon so looking forward to that I&#39;m really busy but I&#39;ll try to go to the beach because I can&#39;t  I&#39;m really good at controlling my temper actually I&#39;ve only been in like I&#39;m 30 years old I&#39;ve been in like six fights maybe and all six of them were started by the other person so I&#39;ve never started a real fight in my whole life like I started fighting a little kid but talking about like a real stuff like what you get past like 13-14 but yeah I know I&#39;m good like every now and then like there&#39;s been in the past were like I wasn&#39;t able to control it  but as far as I ever being violent or anyting that&#39;s never occurred and never would but for the majority of the time yeah I don&#39;t have like people do stupid things all the time and I just like Let It Go expect to like I&#39;m on the freeway and stuff but  oh I mean I get about with my ex girlfriend a lot but it was just about really Petty things I guess that maybe we just I think we were good for each other but maybe some other lifetime because we just bumped head too much so obviously she&#39;s my ex-girlfriend probably for a reason so  we just argued about girlfriend boyfriend thing  I guess my film  there&#39;s a lot of stuff I got to handle differently about  maybe like when I was doing really good when I was younger and I was working for  production assistant for a filmmaker&#39;s around where I live in Sacramento so I was doing everything that I want to do as far as my dreams are concerned and had a lot on my stuff together I have my own car mode apartment and then I got involved with like the wrong group of people I guess and kind of tumble down hill from there in like lost everything like our apartment so I just wish that maybe I never got involved with those kind of people that kind of girl ever  because I would probably a pirate my life probably a lot different now however I believe that everything happens for a reason and obviously I think you should also like stuff that happens good or bad  learn from your mistakes so that when it happens again you could not make that mistake our try not to make it as bad yes so you know  I guess  hardest decision  the hardest decision I have ever had the maid would be  I guess you could say I don&#39;t really know  can I say that I  maybe like my ex-girlfriend like I couldn&#39;t like  stayed with her and I really like it still am in love with her and would like to be with her and miss her but I guess the biggest decision that I had to make was like I know that wasn&#39;t like a healthy relationship and I know if we like stay together if we got married or have kids that I don&#39;t think would end up working out anyways so I guess the decision the hardest decision would be till like actually stay away from her and not get back with her and not with her so I guess that was a hard really hard decision because I could easily have done it and I guess maybe I would have been happier that way but stressed out and irritable or whatever and other way of having to deal with her iguess deal with each other our relationship so it&#39;s really hard still is so I guess that&#39;s not choosing to be with someone that I loved and loved me  or whatever so  what was that  I beg your pardon  navad  I understand the first part of that question  oh an event own event okay that can erase  event that I can erase for my memory  IMAX girlfriend I wish I never met her  my first girlfriend in my last girlfriend I wish I never met them cuz we were we were together and love for a few years and then we broke up and it was really hard so I guess both of them  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep extremely I could fall asleep anywhere I actually the other day I broke a record I almost fell asleep standing up which would have been weird because I guess I would have fallen down or something I don&#39;t know I just caught myself I guess I was I mean I was really tired but I do a lot of stuff so it&#39;s hard for I don&#39;t really get that much sleep  as much as I would like but I can sleep when I&#39;m dead or whatever  have they said  I know  no  lately I&#39;m just tired but I&#39;m all right I guess I&#39;m dealing with this breakup still it&#39;s only been like a month and a week but it&#39;s actually is not I mean I&#39;ve had worse things happen I mean worst things happening had worse things happen to us  well-known religious person that I&#39;m Catholic I believe in God I know there&#39;s a God so obviously even though all of it even devoted people to God regardless of what they are they sometimes stay so I do stay sometimes but definitely last for that long and I know that there is a God and I know that I&#39;ll be okay and everything will be okay but you know it&#39;s hard to deal with them like I don&#39;t really I just keep going and I go to school and work and I just have to keep going I can&#39;t give up so I just try to stay busy and staying busy helps kind of been like sleeping a lot house but I don&#39;t go to sleep a lot so I don&#39;t know playing poker  playing basketball helps me deal with him hanging out with my friend sometime  I felt really happy on Friday because I went to San Diego for the first time and I didn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t as cool as I thought it would be but we&#39;re like under circumstances as far as like my friend had business to take care of and it took a long time so I would much rather been free during that time but I wasn&#39;t but we had fun it was cool I enjoyed it so yeah I really like that I was at fun and I was happy about going to San Diego for the first time and I am had a good time  a lot of things but I guess I would say like be nicer to like family members know a couple family members that I wish I would have been different to  at the different to not that I was like a horrible but I could have been nicer in some instances that if I didn&#39;t know the situation at hand and I would have never like really went out and partied all the time like I did like Highschool different part times of a type I would have just really focused on schooling and stuff them in to the party later would have gotten relationships that I&#39;m sorry I just told myself more basely to be more have more Direction be more focused I guess I stay away from people and unhealthy relationships and healthy people I guess not that I&#39;m the healthiest but yeah I just want it done a lot of stuff different but I don&#39;t know if she said earlier but I believe everything happens for a reason  so I guess everything is happening now for reason something to keep going  I guess there&#39;s a few that I do have a few that I used to have cuz I have best friends now couple I guess one new one and I&#39;ve lost a few best friends as far as like just not we like 100 ways but I guess they&#39;re all probably describe me more as like energetic funny crazy loud silly  smart and I just I guess in general just like entertaining to be around I have  I haven&#39;t always been the best bestest best friend but I tried you know my hardest  so that&#39;s cool  change myself  I wish I was  I wish I was like 15 pounds lighter  I wish I didn&#39;t need  how do I set potatoes I feel like  I feel like I&#39;m I feel like I need to be like in a relationship with a girl but I feel like I wish I didn&#39;t have to be like feel like that I needed to have a girl all the time and so I get that, like focus more and I wish that like I didn&#39;t need sexual I wasn&#39;t always think about sexual stuff towards girls all the time as far as like me having to be in a sexual thing with them like as far as like wanting sex as much as I do cuz I feel like if I didn&#39;t concentrate our have to like be with girls are in a relationship to like well I don&#39;t know how to say it but I was saying like there&#39;s a guy friends that I know that don&#39;t need sex as much as I do and I feel like I need it more than I feel like sometimes that I wish I didn&#39;t need as much so maybe I guess I&#39;m addicted to it a little bit more like I can focus on more things other than just I mean I don&#39;t just focus on sex but I just feel like if I focused on it if I didn&#39;t want it need it or think I need it as much that I could get  step dad in my life  but that sometimes I&#39;m working on that  what am I most proud of  I&#39;m most proud of  almost I guess I guess I&#39;m most proud of working for television station back in Sacramento and working on a lot of them film sets cuz like I I was 16 and I decided I want to be a filmmaker and then two years later or year-and-a-half later you basically I got I started making steps to become a filmmaker and then I ended up working in the business and working as a filmmaker for a really really really good I&#39;m cinematographer I really good I&#39;m freelancing to Target for those that lives in Sacramento that deal I think so I&#39;m proud that I had a dream and I went for it and I actually ended up doing stuff to go toward my dream that were in my dream so I guess that&#39;s one of my biggest accomplishment which was like over 10 years ago but I know hopefully something like that could happen again soon or no  perfect  goodbye  cool
378 okay I&#39;m pleased  are you okay with this yes  pretty good  I grew up in Boston  about 30 years ago  yep  I&#39;m too often maybe once a year sometimes less  oh I love living in that way I don&#39;t ever want to live anywhere else  well I came out here to go to college and I wanted to be far away from my parents and the weather was good and  that&#39;s part of it  a very easy well maybe somebody&#39;s at the beginning the first few weeks for it&#39;s really hard to just be in a new environment and to be away from everybody I knew but after a few weeks it was great  broadcast journalism  well it&#39;s something I&#39;d wanted to do since I was 12 and everything I did from the time I was twelve until I went to college with sort of in pursuit of that dream  are you still working in that nope  well it&#39;s kind of a long story but I got laid off from my first job when I was in my 20s and it just once I&#39;d done that work I realized that&#39;s not really what I wanted to do is to cut throat of a business and it just really wasn&#39;t suited for me didn&#39;t make me happy  yep  dream job my dream job is working with football players and helping them recover from concussions and other injuries  well the work itself is not very hard I&#39;m very good at what I do. The hard part is finding the right people and making the connections to work with them  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I have not much of a world Explorer you travel a lot I used to I don&#39;t travel so much right now  what do you enjoy about  I love seeing different places and different things like I love going to places that are not like  where I&#39;m from  I love to hear about one of your trips my favorite trip is I went to Australia from my 30th birthday  cuz I wanted to lose my 30th birthday as I cross the International Date Line  and I went to this really small place up on the West Coast of Australia called sharks Bay where Native dolphins live and swim and is very isolated for the most part and I got to be there for a whole weekend just really just pretty much by myself with all these wild dolphins and they come in they swim with you and it&#39;s amazing just a beautiful beautiful spot in the world  more shy  why that&#39;s a good question partly the first thing I think of is cuz I&#39;ve always been that way but maybe that&#39;s an excuse I don&#39;t know  I just prefer to be quiet and I&#39;d rather be with fewer people than lots of people  so  I watch TV about this probably not the best alternative but it is something I do and I also walk on the beach cuz I live close to the beach so that&#39;s one of my favorite things to relax  pretty good  it depends on the situation but most of the time I&#39;m pretty good  I don&#39;t think I tend to argue with people I think I just get mad about situations but not at people directly  turn up I feel guilty about anything at the moment  that you wish you would handle differ  not sure I have one at the moment  noise other people&#39;s noise makes me really mad I live across the street from a bar and these people are so rude and obnoxious and not consider it their neighbors that that just makes me really mad  yeah  well I&#39;m only want the comes to mind off the top of my head is is when I bought my condo it feel like a really hard decision at the time you know I didn&#39;t know that I could do it I didn&#39;t wasn&#39;t sure if I had the money to do it  so thoughtful like a really difficult decision but in hindsight course it turned out to be a great decision but at the time it was really difficult to do that  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty easy I sleep pretty well  for the most part good I&#39;m I&#39;m just really worried about money at the moment so that&#39;s my biggest so I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m like great but it&#39;s cuz I&#39;m worried but you know I&#39;m also confident that things are going to work up  have you ever been diagnosed with p  nope  I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t remember  I mean I don&#39;t feel super happy all the time but I don&#39;t feel unhappy either sort of like just a even keel  really enjoy  well I got to go to the my friends work at the motion picture Academy so I get to see all the enough Oscar nominated movies  she was there one night so I really enjoyed catching up with her and seeing her again so that was very pleasant  nice  how your best friend describe you  I think they would say reliable and  well  and considerate and thoughtful  no I really worked hard on that I think there&#39;s lots of things maybe I would do differently but there&#39;s nothing that really I regret  well I just think that there are things that  like it&#39;s not worth wasting the energy to think about things that I regret so I don&#39;t have a lot of regrets about things  that&#39;s a good question don&#39;t worry about the small stuff  and save more money  well as soon as you know the normal things like I&#39;d lose more weight than I would  think be a little more Fearless Maybe  be a little more bold  I don&#39;t think I have any of those  it&#39;s been your ideal weekend  well I&#39;m I&#39;m self-employed so I work all the time so my ideal weekend is having lots of clients that&#39;s something I enjoyed  so that would that would be ideal if this point my weekends if I were really busy  how to make your life  that I&#39;ve really been able to take care of myself and that you know I&#39;ve done pretty much everything that I&#39;ve said that I wanted to do  I&#39;ve done that and I don&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have regrets about things there&#39;s nothing really that is unfilled undone in my life sure there&#39;s plenty of things I still want to do but I feel like I&#39;ve done what I said I was going to do  yeah that&#39;s not so great so it&#39;s okay with my parents are deceased and I have a sister and a brother  I feel closer to my brother than my sister but they both live in the east coast and I live in LA and then my sister has two girls so I feel very close to my nieces although we don&#39;t talk as much as we used to cook their teenager so  I have other things on their mind  probably my teacher person I&#39;ve learned my holistic Bodywork from I really like to model my work in my way of being after him the keys are a good role model for me the way he holds his work in the way he lives his life  I&#39;m pretty close we&#39;re not you know that&#39;s her friends but I do I know that I can call him anytime I need him  what are some things that usually put you in a good mood  you&#39;re being with my friends are going out to dinner or  yeah just spending time with my friends  okay  thanks  it works again
313 that shows you that  who started the virtual human and she&#39;s going to chat with you for a bit and then she&#39;s good when she finishes them to give you the doorbell so you can let me know  Lexi  are you okay  sure  okay I guess not bad not good  so so  Denver Colorado  to pursue job opportunities  about 2 years ago  once or twice a year  I really like the sunshine all the opportunities all the different kinds of people lots of stuff to do  that sort of thing  I hate the traffic  I wish the seasons were more distinct and everything cost a lot of money here  pretty easy  say  people are rude  not having enough money  what else  just a lot of things are frustrating I guess  I guess it depends on what I&#39;m annoyed about like that another person or about something I did or just life in general  if somebody like a person and always me I&#39;ll probably let them know they&#39;re annoying me until they stop  that what you&#39;re talking about  so so not not as good as I&#39;d like to be  a few days ago about getting paid for something I did on time  pretty pissed off taken advantage of  I like to go to the gym  hang out with friends read right sort of thing  at times  because sometimes I like to keep to myself and don&#39;t feel like showing what about word emotion  I have a degree in in Liberal Arts major in political science  I work in sales  209  several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams  guess that&#39;s a job  I used to live in Mexico City that was pretty memorable  how much is pretty different than anything I&#39;ve ever experienced a lot of fun supposed to lot of new things and new people is pretty young and carefree Good Times  not recently but I have in my life traveled quite a bit  Marseille  I went to London has lot of fun pretty cool City little too expensive but definitely cool  of what does anything in life  what&#39;s good question  moving tellabs pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to move here so that was memorable I would say  maybe like  6 months ago  things are just going really well  didn&#39;t have much stress in my life  I&#39;m easier more easily irritated and  yell more tired more  kind of down feeling down more  not as productive  yeah while ago  don&#39;t exactly it&#39;s been a few years but I still feel the same as I did when they diagnosed me so I assume I still depressed  well I just said I&#39;m a big believer in talking to people about your problems so I just thought  that would  be a good idea so I did and that&#39;s what I found out  oh yeah definitely  I mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like I are most people probably can&#39;t afford therapy but just even talking to friends I would consider therapy somebody who listen so helps you get stuff off your chest  thanks  well I haven&#39;t necessarily seen a therapist per se but when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff  like out there like out of your head or whatever it&#39;s it&#39;s it helps to destress I think  pretty girls  I&#39;m a good leader I&#39;m really smart  being able to  survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help  yeah that stuff  just dumb mistakes I made when I was younger that  Looking Back Now with what I know now I probably would not have made  I would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible  he&#39;s always good for a  sort of pep talk but with a dose of reality doesn&#39;t sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective  talented  and I don&#39;t know good at stuff and get it a lot of stuff people seem to notice that I I guess nice could this position funny  okay  simulator  all right  are you like controlling a person in the back or today
603 hello  she seems nice  boys size 10  when she says goodbye  okay  yes  all right little tired  awesome  I grew up just outside of Philadelphia and I move to Los Angeles I&#39;m almost 5 years ago  weather for sure also I was a film major in business minor in school so I came out to be involved in entertainment  traffic smog some of the people are a little flaky but I generally like la  no quite the opposite I consider myself an extrovert  enjoy reading  get a glass of wine perhaps throw on an old movie try to get out of the apartment and maybe take a walk something like that  cruelty  people not using their people being careless or thoughtless you know not really giving consideration to other people when they knew things  usually vocalize my annoyance like unless I figured would be really inappropriate in the moment but I&#39;ll usually let somebody know as gently as possible then I&#39;m kind of annoyed with what&#39;s going on  usually pretty good but I also you know there&#39;s like a limit point where I go past and it&#39;s like that I cannot control it really anymore so I have a long fuse but  hadabah large amount of dynamite there sometimes  I had an argument with my girlfriend recently and it was  you know we&#39;re very different communication Styles so  I guess  I was not feeling heard and she was not feeling like my response was appropriate at the time maybe  I was a film and media arts major and business minor and I actually got my masters of Business Administration it  right now I&#39;m looking for work preferably something entertainment-related but I will take anything that will help pay the bills and let me continue living on the west side  I what I really wanted to do was to produce films so that was sort of my concentration in the film major and I did a couple of internships for production companies as an undergrad end in in my master&#39;s program and I like working with creative people and developing stories and developing projects and being the person that can go from the business and legal people to the creative people on try to make everyone happy and make some money  I tried to I mean I&#39;m a little low on funds right now but I really enjoy traveling I drove cross-country when I moved from Philadelphia to La so I drove down the east coast to Savannah then all through the South and the Southwest I&#39;ve been to England four times I&#39;ve been to Continental Europe twice lot of the islands Montreal  it&#39;s only place I&#39;ve been to in Canada but a lot more of the US and also Asia Africa Australia those places I&#39;ve not been to yet but I&#39;d love to go  what&#39;s a may be the first time I ever left the country first time ever went to Europe we got to take the train to Glacier Express through the Alps in Switzerland and was unbelievable with the snow and things like that and I took a lot of pictures and I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s one of the most beautiful things I&#39;ve ever seen so really sticks out in my mind  I&#39;m very close with my parents I talked with my mom on the phone probably two or three times a week I just talked to my father for Father&#39;s Day the other day and you know he always he sends me emails of news things that you found interesting or stuff that&#39;s related to  film and things like that so I&#39;m close my sister like I have a niece and a nephew on very close with them I talked to my sister a decent amount and I always see them when I&#39;m home for the holidays but they&#39;re all in the Philadelphia area so I&#39;m I&#39;m not physically around them only maybe once a year twice at the most if there&#39;s a wedding or something like that  there&#39;s been a lot  definitely my parents some of my teachers in high school and that sort of encouraged me  like my social studies microcultures Professor my one of my English teachers my phone program I did a summer internship program twice and they had one of her professors for my film  101 class like was the moderator for that so kept in touch with him as well  I like it a lot better now  my last roommate was only you somebody from the MBA program also was a year behind me and he was a terrible roommate he just moved out so I was replaced by somebody else who is  Young and nice and he has the money for rent and he has a rabbit and he&#39;s just like he&#39;s a pretty cool guy so got a decent-sized place I&#39;ve got the bigger bedroom of the two and the rent is not too bad and I get to live like in Culver City Mar Vista side of town which I really enjoy so I like where I live and the rent is not bad for the neighborhood not at all but a little broke right now so I got to get back working again and and  calm down the the money situation but the living situation itself is fine  I have one roommate yes  no I have not  yes  well I mean I guess in college I was seeing a cognitive therapist for a while  but I&#39;ve never medication anything like that and I kind of got away from it but  last summer but about a year ago, came back and I was being the individual counselor at school I was doing group counseling sessions and they had me on Wellbutrin  so I guess a year  yes  I had a DUI which you know all of my drinking I think was really predicated more about the depression not being able to handle that properly so that was part of it and then just the stress of school he was having problems they&#39;re having problems in my relationship and you know is that okay really low point and I felt terrible so I decided I should probably do whatever I could do in order to get better  okay  not took a leave of absence from school so that&#39;s not really available to me but I still go to like a surprise sobriety support group and you know if they&#39;re going back to school to possibility so I might John go back to doing the counseling sessions there but my health insurance runs out in like two months so I don&#39;t really have I won&#39;t really have a way to see someone unless I see Department of  health or something like that so we&#39;ll see  I definitely think that there people that are probably on medication that are not in therapy that probably should be I&#39;d rather do therapy without medication the medication therapy that is for sure so I definitely think it&#39;s a it&#39;s a positive to  speak with something on a regular basis who is sort of removed from your life and objective about it and  don&#39;t just listen that&#39;s really the most important part is I&#39;m coming to listen  yeah me just having dedicated time of like an hour or so you know 50 minutes whenever two or somebody gets to listen to what&#39;s going on with you and and offer some possible  guidance in that direction you know in the direction you want to go I think is always positive  and force you to be like more mindful of what actually bothering yourself when you have to vocalize in and tell them what you&#39;re feeling and try to help figure out why and what you can do about it I think that&#39;s always a good thing  that my mood has been a lot better  that was a really down black time that last oppressive. So  it&#39;s been a lot more. Like the future and what I&#39;m doing and  the way I&#39;m thinking about things and it supposed to just like stumbling through an existing I&#39;m like trying to think more about what I really want to in what I believe in the things that are healthy for me and  all the stuff in the should be should been doing before but wasn&#39;t  I&#39;m settling in for the Moon  I wasn&#39;t drinking often but when I was I was drinking to get drunk I was very very down there was some weight gain I was sleeping a lot to enjoy as much and I was worried about money I was worried about where with recommend I decided which I still am to an extent but it&#39;s not like bringing me down so much now  caught up in a down. Like a rut that I couldn&#39;t get out of  I think it was probably just  not feeling successful in the things I wanted to do and I just got swept up in the day-to-day of like oh well I don&#39;t have a job and I don&#39;t have any money and I&#39;ll try to figure it out and I&#39;ll do this interview and that&#39;s not going to really delete anything and it was just a very  you know I wasn&#39;t moving anywhere wasn&#39;t I was stuck in one spot like that  about not drinking  I&#39;m just to let you know try to be a little bit more mindful of what I&#39;m doing and why I&#39;m doing it you know if I get if I end up in back in school again I&#39;m going to definitely take up the counseling sessions again I don&#39;t know if I want to be back on medication I don&#39;t like that was good for the time frame it was in but I don&#39;t have to become everything or just good I&#39;m trying to get back in shape now I join the gym and figure that&#39;s going to help me to but the main thing is going to be figuring what to do my life cuz I&#39;m 30 now so I feel like I&#39;m to get the real career started  okay just really worried about the money situation because I don&#39;t have the student loans to fall back on anymore and stuff so I&#39;m pretty broke pens doing it again  nice  probably more positive now I would say in general I still love that The Temper switch like I&#39;m I&#39;m still on  the same things that bother me in the past still bother me but they&#39;re not permanently like getting me down there just I would be upset about something in the moment and need to express that and then figure out a solution or Let It Go as opposed to staying in that funk so I can more resilient definitely  yeah most of the time  like I said if I do get upset about things I&#39;m not somebody who likes to keep things inside  but even getting Mountain Pass wouldn&#39;t really get me through them you know would be something I&#39;d really have to slog through it would take me down for sure but now I feel a little bit more comfortable with feeling I&#39;m feeling and getting a house and then trying to work through it  some days I do you know but it&#39;s not everyday and it&#39;s not like for no particular reason anymore I mean I may be down because I&#39;m stressed out cuz I have such a problem that you know I need to address in the in life like my lack of funds right now and you not trying to get in bad shape and you know trying to figure out what to do with my education that I have so far and find what I want to do like that something that people should be worried about but I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s any anxiety or anything like that as we know our sadness or fear is dominating anymore  how is your day  I&#39;m usually okay I&#39;ve been  going to bed later and wake me up later and since I&#39;ve not had a job so that is something I need to watch out for cuz I really need to start waking up earlier in order to apply for things and go you don&#39;t meet people in person and try to figure something out on the job site of things but I&#39;m I&#39;m sleeping okay I&#39;m not  being Sleepless or anything like that there are definitely some days where I feel like staying in bed sometimes but  physically I feel okay  that sucks I mean I&#39;ve definitely I almost feel like I&#39;ve liked cold symptoms 5 only get four or five hours of sleep or something like that I won&#39;t know the runny nose I&#39;ll feel a little feverish I&#39;ll be hungry at weird times like I&#39;ll just be very run down and I did I don&#39;t like that feeling at all I try to get likes every 8 hours sleep every night  probably when I was home over the holidays for the holidays I could spend half my parents and my niece and nephew and my sister and I got to see some of my old friends I got to see some of my extended family generally good feeling and is also my mom&#39;s birthday on the 27th of December so that was a fun occasion as well  I would say very intelligent very funny a little bit too intense a little bit crazy but nobody loyal also generally a  a good person a nice person  I work a lot of things in my life I&#39;ve done some things like that to you I definitely regret that you know I dropped out of the first college that I went to cuz things are really going badly for me at that time and I kind of regret that I think it might have been the right thing to do but I wish I would have been nice to be able to finish school you know on time and start a career that way you know I generally try to behave the way I would feel couple sleeping at night after work but you know everybody fails it something so anytime I&#39;ve lied any time I&#39;ve caught something any time I&#39;ve felt like I&#39;ve wasted an opportunity  she&#39;s inquisitive
458 so you guys are controlling the virtual human okay yes  I&#39;m doing fine thank you  I&#39;m from Los Angeles California yes  I love man saying I like the weather I like the lifestyle I like the variety of beach know we have it all  things I don&#39;t like about La the rent is way way way way too expensive it&#39;s ridiculous  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes  I have I&#39;m well-travelled  nice  enjoy.  I enjoy seeing new places going new places it&#39;s different every where the people are different  it&#39;s fun  okay well the most recent is last year I went to family reunions in New Orleans so that was in June and while I was there we also visited Slidell Louisiana for the the swamp tours and Vicksburg Mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in Ferriday Louisiana with my aunt to will be 101 this year in May  there&#39;s a lot as far as traveling or just.  Most memorable experience and well I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just one probably when  I used to travel with my dad that&#39;s where I got a lot of my traveling from  can you tell me about  yeah it was best car sometimes planes mostly white just I guess I&#39;ll say mostly down south but it was really fun especially the road trips  just a general and also drama  what&#39;s your dream job  my dream job is to become a real estate investor  well I&#39;ve sort of really been into it every since 2005 I just don&#39;t have the capital right now or the connections but since I do like real estate I&#39;m just going to start off as a real estate agent so I should have my license sometime this year  outgoing  I&#39;m well I&#39;m not sure why it could be a little bit of both but I&#39;m pretty outgoing  well speaking of Hawaii I did live there for a year and a half but what do I do to relax is either I&#39;m usually take a nap take a bath  or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways  it needs to be worked on but I know when to control it when I need to  well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments is this just over a text message but I&#39;m actually it was my fault but usually it&#39;s his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control butt  that&#39;s usually how it goes  well I don&#39;t know what else to do except for pray on it because I thought once I moved into another house it would be over but I see that we&#39;re still getting into it so I don&#39;t know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right than them be right I guess  probably quite a few things but I don&#39;t regret anything I&#39;ve done in my life but  situation I wish I would have handled differently just  kind of everything in my life almost I could have done it differently or I would if I had the chance but I&#39;m not worried about it cuz I don&#39;t regret anything that I&#39;ve done in my life  tell me about  the hardest decision probably when I had to get a divorce that that may have been the hardest a one of the hardest decisions  it was just a lot of a lot of stuff through the years the relationship is kind of deteriorated the relationship between us was still good then the things that he were doing I would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because I would feel like well our relationship is good and it&#39;s difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there&#39;s just a lot of disagreement and arguing and problems financial problems and he&#39;s doing this so I  I just decided just forget it I mean I tried but you know he didn&#39;t want to cooperate so  well I&#39;m happy with what&#39;s going on now I mean I wish that we could still be a family but since that&#39;s not going to happen yes I am happy with my life right now yes  something I can erase  I don&#39;t think I really need to erase anyting I finally got an over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that I can&#39;t think of anything to erase  it&#39;s fair / good there is no problems right now so I guess I&#39;ll just say good yeah there&#39;s no problem  well I would have to say my mother yes  I&#39;m with she&#39;s just always supported me and everything that I&#39;ve done whether it&#39;s good or not so good so I think that&#39;s a blessing  sometime sometime it&#39;s not  well I just don&#39;t get enough hours of sleep I guess that&#39;s what it is cuz I would like to sometimes so that&#39;s more the problem I would like to get  I&#39;m just sleepy yeah sleepy tired feeling like I want to go take a nap  I&#39;ve been feeling fine  I know they&#39;ve been about the same  have you ever been  no  no  I&#39;m really happy probably last week because I got over to a little bit of money so  well I guess my best friend will be my mom or maybe my entertainment friend that I&#39;ve been knowing since 96 I really wouldn&#39;t I&#39;m not going to say I don&#39;t consider him a best friend that we don&#39;t really hang out that much but he is very ungenerous to me and my mom  so  well right now I spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in  but maybe after the class work is out of the way maybe I could do something else  myself well I do wish that at times I could control my temper a little more and of course I would like to lose weight be a little bit more active and I wish my skin would clear up  it was probably when I was in school school years or terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals so they try to make you feel like you&#39;re nothing like your piece of turd on to their foot so that&#39;s probably the last time is an adult now  I would say that I&#39;m genuine I&#39;m honest I&#39;m supportive  and I&#39;m just a good friend  no  did you give yourself  well 20 years ago just because you&#39;re pregnant that doesn&#39;t mean that you&#39;re eating for two and you can eat loads of food like people tell you that&#39;s the main thing I&#39;m I&#39;m going to tell my daughter&#39;s no I&#39;m just eat as you normally eat the eat more healthier there&#39;s no need to gain 80 lb when the baby is just 20 pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose also know if I came into any money now 20 years ago I was probably just thinking about shopping or just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff where is now I would invest it  so yeah I think that&#39;s about it  proud of  I guess maybe myself my kids  hey thank you  bye

718 how long should this person last okay  sure  I&#39;m doing okay it&#39;s Friday  where you from  I&#39;m originally from Alabama from the Gulf Coast born and raised  if I put my glasses on her  I like the  I like the weather in general it does kind of hot and sometimes it&#39;s a little overbearing but I like that you could go from the beach within an hour to the mountains with their self so that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty diverse I guess I like that  I don&#39;t like the traffic it&#39;s sometimes it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s crazy and  an unbearable also don&#39;t like the the weather conditions given the smog and so forth which can be a little bit if you live in the valley it&#39;s just me I was just a big Heat ball be a little bit unbearable as well  I used to travel a lot I used to when I was in the Army I lived in in Germany so I used to travel every chance I could take over every weekend I would travel throughout Germany now so much so I don&#39;t travel this much since I&#39;m still married and so forth but I used to travel more or less more International than than anything  I mostly in George&#39;s hanging out and meeting new people I also I love history so when I remember when I was in Prague I would love taking a reading about something in the context of my travels and and and and applying at to the the current meow Museum or whatever I remember when I went to South Africa when I was in Cape Town at the same thing you did you know you&#39;re reading a lot of books in the contacts and then you go and you see it and it&#39;s like well you know it&#39;s not just getting it off the internet or anything like that so I enjoy that  okay well I  couple years back I was in South Africa and I was doing research for for for college until I was there working for a private Equity Firm and even before I got there at Nelson Mandela&#39;s book with 500 page biopic kind of thing in action making it to the movie but I read it and I was like you know I&#39;m going to check this out so I went to Robben Island which was pretty cool where it was Kept For about 25-30 years and the city reminds me of San Francisco and if you&#39;re going to San Francisco but the city reminds me of San Francisco steep Bluffs right off the coast of the Indian Ocean there but I enjoyed it I had a I had a great great time taking in the sights and you get to see a lot of the Dutch Colonial stuff and you know and all that kind of just mix in  together and it&#39;s a great wine to have a lot of grape Vineyards Vineyards down in that part of the South  and Cape Town or just in general are in traveling  at school I studied I studied business I studied Finance and Accounting so I  I kind of had a minor in military studies are military science is what it was called and undergrad but for the most part I studied finance and in grad school I studied Finance and Accounting  I I write and I do Consulting  so I do Consulting for finance so I I do about 50/50 riding and then Consultants.  my dream job is to be JJ Abrams so that&#39;s my dream job actually I would love to do just got to do something more creative flashlight but I consider is creative is is is the thing that interests me is because you get to create all these different packages and bundle them and derivatives that&#39;s no different from writing to me you know so it&#39;s the same thing so I just want to do something that&#39;s kind of creative and that&#39;s kind of aligned to just looking at new things in a different way and that&#39;s the way I&#39;ve always been  I&#39;m in general Eminem Morven I&#39;m more of an outgoing kind of guy that&#39;s just but you know I don&#39;t mind you know when I&#39;m home I&#39;m kind I don&#39;t turn on the TV and and do whatever I&#39;ll pick up a book and I&#39;ll read a book as opposed to you know  you watching TV or playing Xbox or whatever so that&#39;s that&#39;s me  why because the other stuff doesn&#39;t seem it&#39;s interesting you know I think there&#39;s a lot of things that are really interesting and and and and and usually using your imagination and then picking up a book it&#39;s just kind of raw it&#39;s just you know Sun filter kind of thing so that&#39;s that&#39;s me  I have a great relationship with my family  I  have a wife and kids I also have a family is back in Alabama and Georgia and for my immediate family we we know I have to divide my time between that my only interest in my family but we do a lot of great things that are centered around the kids my wife is moral as an East coaster so she&#39;s from New York area so we do things that are  turn around her and him do things for the kids cuz the kids have interest so we I just tried to balance it and I have my stuff do some kind of last but we do have a lot of diverse interests which is great  what do I do to relax  I  I would my I&#39;d like to go  I I like I think I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my temper I&#39;m more of a laid-back kind of guy I mean I&#39;m that kind of guy you know I&#39;m a little bit you know you just you know at some point you know it enough is enough but I I&#39;m pretty I&#39;m pretty polished and how I have done you know you know being an army been an army officer when I was in the military and going through all the cadet training and stuff you really do a lot and how they interact with management and so forth so I&#39;m okay with track with my temper and everybody has their breaking point and what I do to relax I like to go for a walk mostly I like to be outside  I probably shan&#39;t argue with ya sure I could say I argue with my wife and it probably was about something related to the kids are the kids in money or something like that we have kid at for kids and integrate kids but but kids are a little expensive at times and then so I don&#39;t remember what it was but it was a ballet class or something like that and it wasn&#39;t necessarily free I&#39;ll put it that way and you know so we can if we had an argument about it because she was just one of those things where you know my wife you know you know you know if she if the kids has an interest and anything related to anything you say let&#39;s let&#39;s invest all of this in it and it&#39;s see what happens after while you like okay fine  a situation I wish I would have handled differently  I would probably  okay that&#39;s even the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make was when I was in the Army and I had to fire someone who has been in the service for 15 years that was pretty tough because this person went out and he had I guess made a bad decision you had a DUI and he had the family and he had people that depended on him and we had to remove them from this position and I was a junior officer at the time and I wasn&#39;t charged with with doing the firing so it&#39;s kind of weird size you know if someone you go out you have beer with there a drink with than and actually you know you got as far as first so that was hard because you know it&#39;s one of those things where are you  you really wanted things about the military at you you always hear the stories of where you shouldn&#39;t I guess been an officer you shouldn&#39;t be so involved with your peers are your subordinates and that&#39;s what the thing and it&#39;s it was true for me because I I was a cool laid-back kind of guy and and when it&#39;s time to make decisions like that their tot interpersonal because you you realize that you&#39;re affecting someone to livelihood and and that stuff  tell me about  yes that&#39;s her name of her  and in general I&#39;ve been okay you know  not like  I&#39;ve been okay some days are great some days are a crappy but on average there okay now it&#39;s not so what I call swing it away  not lately I do feel  that  I do feel that  the older I get the older I get I&#39;m just more like you know inpatient about certain things you know just get you know you&#39;re you know you think that when you&#39;re younger or more  impatient  it&#39;s okay like I can easily is there something I said I better not as I guess I I find that  I can get a good night&#39;s sleep when  when I go to bed at a certain time if I go to bed too early it&#39;s it&#39;s not good  my falculty these are not old all their I need more to become engaged throughout my day and I&#39;m easily distracted  I have not  I have not  I felt really happy I can say last weekend although I did have some down on me but I took my is my wedding anniversary and I took the wife and kids went to Disneyland and I guess it is a happiest place on Earth whatever but really young age where everything is you know you know everything is fun for them so that that makes me happy  my mom is been a positive influence in my life I did mention a group in Alabama group in a single-family household and she&#39;s always been encouraging and I think when they&#39;re so much discouragement around in many different package  they have someone that supportive it&#39;s always great you know it&#39;s always good to have that in your corner because you you going to get it you going to get rejection enough so but to have someone support you and your decisions is always good  I think my best friend would probably say that  I&#39;m a hard worker have a strong work ethic that I&#39;m generally someone who is responsible and easy-going kind of guy well-liked guy  something you did  what I&#39;m most proud of I can say that that that makes me happy you know because it&#39;s something I think that you&#39;re under appreciated sometimes but the  I like when my kids now my oldest kid you know wants to show me something you worked on it&#39;s cool I mean I think that&#39;s great and he&#39;s eight and then it&#39;s just great and it&#39;s good because one day he&#39;s going to grow up and he&#39;s going to have a kid of his owner of a family of his own and so you know I I think the best thing I can do is give him that example of what it&#39;s like to be a dad and to be responsible that&#39;s something I never I never had I never saw so I&#39;m kind of it&#39;s not like I have a textbook to go back in reference or anything but I think you know it makes me proud because you have little Minds that you&#39;re shaping you know a little people that that see what you&#39;re doing and and and that kind of want to be like you so that&#39;s kind of cool  you&#39;re welcome  goodbye  okay
637 okay  I think I got it  what year Buick Minnie Mouse so that were okay like that  okay  okay  and then  and right now she can&#39;t answer any  yes  fine  San Francisco  the beaches fire pits the ocean movies entertainment business the different areas as  the weather  it&#39;s really difficult to get around by bus terrible not having a car  that&#39;s the hardest part you can&#39;t really do all day without a car  in every way  by bus I do  my most memorable experiences  what do they study at school I studied I&#39;m sitting acting right now is what I&#39;m doing  I&#39;m studying acting and I&#39;m working a day job that doesn&#39;t pay enough money so I&#39;m trying to find additional day jobs or I don&#39;t know how to I&#39;m trying to figure out how to live with joy  that&#39;s how to live with joy that&#39;s when your life flows is when you do more of what brings you Joy that&#39;s my current  dilemma  I think my dream job would be weighing 70 lbs less and being a really emotionally diverse actress so I can play comedy roles which is easier for me and too heavy drama rolls which is more of a challenge to be vulnerable and to open up emotionally kind of what I&#39;m standing right now and I would look thousand percent better cuz my hair would be long  I really am thinking I don&#39;t have a family anymore my father passed away and there&#39;s no relationship with my sister and a very poor one with my mother so it&#39;s almost like not having any family anymore  sometime  take a shower  pretty good  I guess it was a couple months ago and  I was a friend that kind of flipped out on me  that would be the situation  I wish I did handle it differently  infidelity  that&#39;s a good question  the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make well I had an amazing cat and  if you can imagine it was more than a cat it was like being a very large entity in the body of a cat and my cat passed away and I had to I wanted to have a proper burial at an animal cemetery and have a memorial service for my cat and my mother was against these ideas that was too much for a cat and so it took me two and a half months to come up with the money to find his casket and to decide on what style of casket I wanted because it was so hard to own that decision when I didn&#39;t get any support over it  but eventually I triumphed and I found an artisan in Tennessee that makes Cedar chests and he made me the most beautiful Cedar casket octagono  octagon all with Ivory lining and plush padding on the inside of the casket and the people at the animal Cemetery said that in 20 years of business they&#39;d never seen such a beautiful casket and they&#39;d never seen someone that gave so much to their animal  so I felt really really good when I saw the way that I was sort of like a sending my cat and I went to the cemetery  then I get erased from my memory I think I have erased a lot of events from my memory  well I probably had a lot of them  weird experiences  definitely  no  well you know I&#39;m a very determined human being so I work myself into being in positive states of mind but overall I think that definitely realizing I have some deep depression and essentially I just need more of a support network here in La I need to create a new family and that&#39;s basically what I need to renew a really do which is difficult because it&#39;s hard to have a family and family and friends you know people that you can really really trust and it&#39;s just hard to get around La without a car  so I feel a lack of support in my life and I feel isolated and lonely  other than that I&#39;m very optimistic  any changes yeah I walk to work which is in Beverly Hills and I walk through Beverly Hills and I noticed that even though I&#39;m walking around nice places I&#39;m a joyless when I&#39;m walking to work doesn&#39;t really make me that happy makes me happier when I get to the commercial part and there&#39;s more people around and there&#39;s lots of kind of like activity and shops it does nothing for me like walking through the neighborhoods I noticed  I noticed that I have a lot of lethargy in my body which is depression  I&#39;m really working hard at going to sleep before midnight and I noticed that it makes a big difference when I do get enough sleep  I&#39;m fine I&#39;m just tired but I think I&#39;m pretty fine energy-wise in terms of interacting with other people  PTSD no  yes  recently  lethargy lack of Joy lack of community lack of close bonds  lack of focus  support network no one to talk to not a lot of energy  to do extra things that would you know help make your life better it&#39;s just sort of get into the struggle of just getting through the day  and then trying to find the energy to do something to make it better  I need to buy something  yeah I think I know what my overall trigger what the overall thing is but it&#39;s deeper than the overall thing itself  that makes any sense well  I  you guys are going to think I&#39;m a complete whack job but honestly I&#39;m really not I called my mother yesterday and I left her a message and at the end of the message I said I love you and that&#39;s a month since she called me which was my birthday when she called me I didn&#39;t answer but she didn&#39;t say she loves me the year before that she didn&#39;t even call me on my birthday and she said she wasn&#39;t feeling well  and we had a falling out in November so I haven&#39;t spoken to her since the following out but essentially what I realized in November was just a tremendous amount of inability to love that she has towards me and I think it&#39;s a lifelong thing so I think it&#39;s hard for me to get close to people and to bond with people because if you can&#39;t trust your mother who can you trust and if you haven&#39;t received love from your mother  and you don&#39;t know really how to receive Love Actually something about receiving lover  receiving self-worth or validation or something like that I think that lack of support you know throughout my whole life regardless of how ambitious or determined I am the there&#39;s an underpinning really everyday you know of sadness about that not having a mother and so that&#39;s I think the main challenge to workout in my psyche or Soul or emotions  something like that  how do I cope with my emotions well I sit with them alone mainly since there&#39;s no one to  share the deeper ones with that would really understand me there was no long-term relationships  but I do interact with my emotions a lot when I&#39;m turning my instrument and in acting class and so that&#39;s a big you know workout emotionally  a couple months ago I went through a patch where I didn&#39;t have a place to stay and ended up staying with someone that I thought was the student friend she turned out to be crazy and I had to leave there and as a result  I had to seek counseling / the Mandate of my school  that&#39;s the incident that triggered it  yes  therapy is useful  it&#39;s a reflective experience so your reflective throughout the week before you see your therapist and then you sort of start thinking on a deeper level about a seam occurrence seeing that&#39;s like what&#39;s really the issue and then it feels very look forward to having someone to talk to you that can really listen so the gift of active listening  and then feeling of satisfaction from another human being caring  about you your welfare and having someone to talk to you on a deeper level  when I was in my acting class which was well I took some classes I audited some classes last week and it does moments lot of joy, and when I was at my school studying which was at two and a half months ago  who&#39;s been a positive influence in my life that would be  the most positive influence was my cat&#39;s Benjamin and my former partner  and  no best friends at the moment  I went to UCB and saw Improv  I&#39;m most proud of my care for my cat  and  I&#39;m most proud of my relationship with my cat and I&#39;m most proud of that I have been making a lot of progress in a working on my career stuff and I have a positive attitude even though it&#39;s very difficult growing up with the family that doesn&#39;t give you the kind of emotional or financial support so grown up with a lot of jealousy and negativity and lack of support  you&#39;re welcome goodbye

has changed over the years I&#39;ve been around since 1952 and I was born here in Los Angeles and I see such changes as far as environmental with the smog and basically that&#39;s about it  I&#39;m sure you can tell them  I&#39;ve judged several places in the United States yes  trying different type of Cuisines I like to go to museum like two historical or a historical buffer going somewhere different than where I&#39;ve been here all my life  I&#39;ll let me start with both try Boston I had never been to Boston before and when I went I was able to look at the Historical the buildings and I went to I saw the Lake Charles and then the boats and stuff with it it was just it was a good experience and it&#39;s another place I went to I took a ferry in it and my mind went on blank on it I can&#39;t even think of it right now but other than that New Orleans I didn&#39;t go to the Mardi Gras just I don&#39;t like to go when it tomorrow to growl when they have a lot of people I just went on the offseason I enjoyed that and I&#39;ve been to Atlanta Georgia  and I have taken a cruise went to the Caribbeans I took Mexico cruise by next cruise I like to go to the Alaska because I want to be able to see certain areas that we haven&#39;t destroyed yet as far as their Environmental  I&#39;m outgoing  as far as going places I don&#39;t have a problem eating alone I don&#39;t have a problem meeting people  I&#39;m only shy and conversing back and forth to a stranger  oh I have a favorite thing I like to go on the internet and I like to do sweepstakes I&#39;m a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contest and I&#39;ve been very successful since I was a kid I&#39;ve won a lot of sweepstakes and in the evening time I find our time and I just go online and just I&#39;m so good at I know just about exactly the right time to even entering I usually try to answer them before midnight when everybody else is asleep so it&#39;s been successful for me  getting married having my children  I have a 27 year old son and I have a 31 year old son both of them when one of us married though it&#39;s not and I just not too long ago became a grandmother I have one grandson and my son he works for the County of Los Angeles assessor property conveyed convenience as amateur and the other one is the computer engineer So and I&#39;ve been married for 33 years and strong  you don&#39;t want  if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to him and find out what&#39;s going on and tell them that you love them on my son I talk to him all the time when he went out the door I love you and even today when they&#39;re call me and hang up a said Mom I love you you always have to give them that that good feeling when they leave the door that you care and I never had to go to head to any jail to get them out they&#39;ve been pretty obedient I mean boys will be boys but I never had any problem as far as them getting into any serious trouble and I&#39;m very proud of that especially the boys I don&#39;t know how it would have been different but  avoid if I have to say it was pretty obedient and they respect the law  the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and I&#39;ve watched my son like I said just grandmother and I watch him how he handles his son and it seems like he&#39;s learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how the hell his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey I got a wife I have a son and it&#39;s my job to make sure that I keep a roof over their heads so it tastes off  and I asked nicely he treats her well  my mother was more Stricker on me but my parents for some unknown reason I guess because I have my sister and I were the girls like they weren&#39;t struck on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didn&#39;t let us go a lot of places and then my parents are so they weren&#39;t typed it like to travel and I used to look at them and say no I&#39;m not going to be like that now I&#39;m going to travel I&#39;m not going to just stay home and I don&#39;t mean that is nothing wrong with him because they  downtown love is home and do things at home but they never really travel anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and I used to try to talk her and get on a plane and go somewhere and she said well I&#39;m going to go here I&#39;m going to go there but you never did she died she never needed to do any trouble so I made up for and want to do something different in the next two to travel more than and be more out there I was more of a social butterfly my mother was not a social butterfly so I made up for it  I think before I speak and then I am the type of person also to take on other people&#39;s feelings before I blow out the wrong thing I try to analyze the situation first because sometimes you can put you open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you would not be able to get out of  it&#39;s probably something about my husband yet I know it was this new construction that my husband is working on our house  we had a disagreement on that then have their own way of doing things and I had told him not to use a certain person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didn&#39;t listen and so I didn&#39;t say I told you so but I guess you can tell by my facial expression that he&#39;d have done wrong and I told him I said look you losing money and it became one problem after another so now I&#39;ll do a construction thing is up in the air right now cuz he knows he has done wrong and I&#39;ll but he doesn&#39;t want to face the fact that what he knows it but he doesn&#39;t want to really face it back so he says I look smart project with our project  so I grabbed this one of the biggest arguments are we having right now that I can think of this recent  I felt that he didn&#39;t really listen to me and he more so looked at cheap or economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways cuz I told him that you need to do your research I&#39;m the type of person I do my research before I jump into something I asked tried to. My eyes and cross my T&#39;s but my husband he&#39;s not like that he&#39;s fight I can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he&#39;s a good friend of mine so I don&#39;t care I mean is he license he doesn&#39;t look at all that stuff he&#39;s he could just jumps into it  witch costumes some extra money unnecessary money that is spent on the end I mean it&#39;s a lot of money and so I was really very upset yesterday I was very upset about it because it was just wasted money that we could have say can we wind up doing the same thing all over again and it didn&#39;t make any sense  I retired early I was very fortunate to retire at age 50 I retired in 2002 I was working for the State of California Disability Alice and what happened was I was able to reason why I was able to retire so early because I&#39;ve been working since I was 18 and I had like 31 and 1/2 years of service and we was so nice about it that I only needed the best in like 10 years in my health insurance so I was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire I&#39;ve been with kelp her and I know if you have a counter but if we have excellent retirement system and since I have been working with them so long  I didn&#39;t get the full percentage I should have stayed Thomas 55 but I got out of that 50 and I didn&#39;t get the full amount but that&#39;s okay I found myself going back doing a little part time job because of the economical reason and then I have one eye that&#39;s so  I think that was the kind of mistake I did I should have kind of waited till I was 55 and 50 but I look at it now as far as the health insurance I really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and I don&#39;t pay very little money so I think that over the gates of the money that I receive  you see the hardest  I probably when my mom died cuz I&#39;m not used to anybody dying and my mother died in 99 of non-hodgkin lymphoma and  putting her funeral together my brother and sister we never we will never face with anybody dying of putting a funeral together and all response because I am the eldest it was put on me and I&#39;m like oh my God what I do is so it&#39;s kind of like trying to find her insurance policy cuz I had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and try to get all the stuff together and finding things you know I myself I keep my things organized time for some unknown reason she didn&#39;t have her Sargon eyes and I think that was the hardest and knowing how much I have to pay cuz I had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and I&#39;m fortunate my mom this is interesting she had one of those small Barrel insurance but she had $1000000 of accident insurance and she didn&#39;t die of course with no accidents he had  local conditions so that was something that we had to pay for the whole just about everything  yeah it was it was but now I can handle that this is something weird but since that I&#39;ve learned from that so I&#39;m I have made it available for my children that my husband died we got together and we want him getting our insurance policy. Insurance policy but what do you call the Bureau Insurance be at that and it&#39;s just that we&#39;ve had it for many many years so it&#39;s almost payday advances 10 years of pay for everything and everything and nothing that I did I&#39;ve even written my own obituary I know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that I don&#39;t want them to go through what I went through and my husband agreed that&#39;s the one thing we did agree on and he said he don&#39;t want anybody to have any problem people  I didn&#39;t tell him what to do it&#39;s already written we did a living trust it&#39;s nothing they can do but make one phone call and that&#39;s it  I have no problem sleeping very well  pretty good  I didn&#39;t a little tired but that&#39;s only because the physical condition I have found out I have vitamin B deficiency in vitamin D deficiency self is more physical but not mental  exercise walk walking more saw  no not really  no  no  I&#39;m basically happy all the time I&#39;m more so I&#39;m making other people happy I get more phone calls as people want inspiration about things when they have projects they working on and then I try to encourage them and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey I really appreciate your input thanks and then they are I&#39;ll follow up on them and see how they&#39;re doing  resource person I&#39;ve been described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because I&#39;m the type of person I research everything I get into just about I just don&#39;t dive into any situation I tried to look up information some I know if we have the technology here that you can get everything on the end of that but I also go back to the old school like that like even finding this place I mean I did the map Google but also I love the Thomas brother I never going to give up my Thomas Brothers map Yellow Pages you be surprised I Don&#39;t Give Up by Yellow Pages so there&#39;s certain little things that I don&#39;t really let go I know we have technology sometimes she&#39;s going to be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology get you have it right at your finger but you can find things and then they say I&#39;m more  Barbie first person the most people come to me just to just look up things and I get that that&#39;s as Funk about it because I like to look for stuff and find it  and that gives me satisfaction  I wish I could have stuff going up and down on my way to lose weight diet before the summer time and and then by Christmas time I have what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if I can stop binging and making food my friend I think that&#39;s it&#39;s a nervous disorder I did I like to eat and but also I don&#39;t like to be overweight either cuz I have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and I can&#39;t get them on right now so I know I saw them when we go on this bench and try to lose weight for the summer time so I can get a no so nice, so it&#39;s mostly not happy with my weight  I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t hear you  no not really I was ready and I can stay skinny again back on  I see you and I&#39;ll be home by 10 or 20 years ago  I would have stayed a little bit more money before I retire  instead of retiring too early  what&#39;s Providence is on my life  meeting a lot of people that came in my life I got good friends I still have 15 of the best friends that I went to elementary school and in very where you can find anybody who can walk around and say they have the same 15 group of friends we were in the sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter fact we just had with all of us and our 6-year birthday and our high school group we put together a 60-year birthday reunions and hear all fifteen of us with the exception of one we&#39;re all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so I think it&#39;s basically keeping the same friends I think we can probably outlive me  okay  you&#39;re welcome bye bye  okay  alrighty

712 so friggin I&#39;m pleased  are you okay with this yes yes  done pretty good  how are you  Philadelphia Pennsylvania  the weather in Latin culture food  music the beaches  what&#39;s better dirty large parts of it getting violent stuff like that  GasBuddy  you travel a lot  I used to in the Marines and growing up I did y&#39;all all over the east coast and around the country out  same thing different different types of people different types of food different types of music seeing different architecture and things like that the east coast and the west coast is very different in terms of how we build our buildings so just different places that you go you see different things like that  turkey we visited the oldest church in the world I believe it was called the oldest church in the world they have those the towers the towers and just a different people I ate goat and some other types of food that I had never eaten before  and I found out the people or are people just like us it&#39;s not just like Americans we might have our perception but people from another country they&#39;re just the same they just have a different language and they just look different but they don&#39;t they&#39;re not different you know  American Experience  I remember everything I have a very vivid memory I remember a lot of things  I don&#39;t know  I was a trumpet player since third grade and I did that in the mornings so I did that for 15 years of my life music  warehousing labor  can I ride my bike a lot  the Los Angeles Philharmonic go to the Boston Pops Orchestra or something like that something big  something like that to you  Lili outgoing I wish I when I was growing up but not anymore  the best of guy yes  I I have music I love all kinds of music so if I just put on my headphones that usually helps or I go for a bike ride I have my bike downstairs I&#39;ll just go as far as I feel like going 10 15 20 miles and then come home that&#39;s very relaxing  I don&#39;t have a temper I used to put it this way my daughter&#39;s mother had a temper and I started to learn it from her but I realize that&#39;s  but that&#39;s not me that that&#39;s not the type of person that I am and so I I  we separated and I&#39;ve long since not been like that yeah  with her only with her never never like in public or with the police or anything like that I would say that she some girls know that they can use the police  they can just say things some girls not all girls and she would do that but no it was never I&#39;ve never like hit a woman or anything like that no  when was the last  my former landlady I just moved about two months ago where I was before my my landlady was a drug addict she didn&#39;t didn&#39;t do anything except drug she didn&#39;t fix anything she was just lazy and everything was unkempt and and  if you are renting to somebody else I had strong views that you should keep up with the property and I which is build up over time and I told her you know I&#39;ve been here and I&#39;ve given you so much money so much money and you haven&#39;t done anything except drugs and it was we got a little heated  I I don&#39;t know because I think the way things end up  is the right way in the end if your Zone as you learn so  Google I said you have any regrets  I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve learned I&#39;ve learned you can&#39;t have regrets cuz y&#39;all at the end of the day you end up in the right place and that&#39;s what you have to look at so I don&#39;t think so I&#39;ve learned from the things that I may have  but I had to learn to understand I&#39;m sure you do  I might as well be honest I know it&#39;s looking at it I know you&#39;re a person on the other side of that but you don&#39;t look like a person but I had a woman that I was chasing and I we were intimate we were together and we were intimate and I shouldn&#39;t you know made me promise not to tell anybody at work and I was so excited and I told somebody cuz I thought I could trust that person and  I couldn&#39;t trust that person and word got out in the hole Restaurant New and she was embarrassed and I broke her trust it was a pretty it was pretty bad but at the same time and again I said that I don&#39;t regret things because she admitted she admitted that it hurt and by admitting it heard it kind of said more  about the situation if somebody could admit to you that you can hurt them that means they&#39;re vulnerable to which said something you know I understand that so I learned something more than maybe had I not done it had I not heard I might not have known  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to  probably coming to California my daughter&#39;s mother and I like I said we didn&#39;t get along and I have a 9 year old daughter who I love and I want the best for so so five years ago she moved out the mother moved out here to meet her new husband and and start a new life and all that and she brought my daughter along and it took me a couple months to get money and everything together for me to do it but I knew when I came out here that I didn&#39;t know anybody we&#39;re from the East Coast I didn&#39;t know anybody I didn&#39;t know nothing about California I looked at a map and I said Santa Monica I know that City I&#39;ll try to get close to there and when it came time for it like the few days before and I knew I bought a bus ticket and I packed as much as I could and I knew that I was moving to the other side of the country  and then I couldn&#39;t turn around that that they missed a huge step it was a huge step and I knew why I was doing it but I was terrified I was 10 I got here and I&#39;m still terrified and it took some time to try to get everything together you know to eventually live with a drug addict that I was with but  for sure getting up and moving and leaving everything and friends that I knew and starting completely brand new that was that was very difficult  a lot of my childhood my parents were abusive and I guess this anonymity thing helps but yeah my parents were my parents were destructive and there&#39;s a lot of things that they did to me as a child that that I wouldn&#39;t wish on other kids  I  I&#39;ve learned that I&#39;m a stronger person but I  I still wouldn&#39;t wish it on somebody else come stronger and I can help other people because of the things I know but but it doesn&#39;t completely justify the stuff that happened to you  yes the Marines  19  I was actually going to go to college for music for trumpet and my parents didn&#39;t help me with any of the decisions and I didn&#39;t know how I was going to get there and  I was so adamant about still playing though  so I don&#39;t know I knew the Marines were something that I could do it would be physical but I could still keep playing and it wasn&#39;t going to be so  like my parents wouldn&#39;t have driven me to college running like that and I had no idea how I was going to make that step I think I fell to the military  was going to be an easier step so to speak I don&#39;t know if that makes sense but yeah it was more streamlined just to get in the military and keep playing that way  are you happy  yeah I would say I learned a lot from from my experiences  you have no regrets you know what I mean I can definitely say that as a marine having been a marine there&#39;s nothing that can break me and I learned that for sure for the military  all right  did you ever see combat no thank God  how is the weather  not easy I would I would say that I right  how do I join  I went to college and pursue that path things would be considerably different  yeah the military and one thing they don&#39;t tell you they think the whole thing about the GI bill that don&#39;t help pay for college but that&#39;s for like vocational schools and stuff like that you don&#39;t really know that and I&#39;m not a vocational school guy  the jobs are quite the same you kind of a little bit older and you already missed that early Windows to get in on a good career  so a lot of people don&#39;t don&#39;t end up where they might have intended to be before they join the military put it that way  to do after the military  bunch of jobs different jobs telemarketing pizza delivery old phones for Verizon Wireless warehousing of done thanks and of course traveled for my daughter  how did serving in the military change you  what&#39;s the weather like I said no matter what comes on no matter what comes my way I know I I&#39;ll be okay and especially physically but just endurance mental endurance after sleeping in the dirt and and waking up in freezing sleeping bags and digging holes and and and sweating to no end and Twenty Mile and stuff like that  life no matter how hard it gets it&#39;s still a piece of cake for me most people wouldn&#39;t say that  how have you been feeling lately  a little bit stressed I&#39;m getting older on 35 and  City harder to find a better job there&#39;s a lot of good in the workforce is not that that you know that this whole thing with the economy it&#39;s not as good as they try to paint it in the news there are lots and lots of people looking for jobs in a lot of them don&#39;t pay enough and a lot of them don&#39;t give enough hours and it&#39;s  I think the economy is a big Downer for for a lot of people  no no no I&#39;m pretty good  I said I&#39;m getting a little bit better actually  like I said I just I just learned to persevere no matter how hard it gets I&#39;ll be okay I&#39;ll be alright  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty good I do sleep well  most most nights  obviously still pretty good I may be a little bit a tad bit sluggish but if I don&#39;t sleep for the night the next night I&#39;ll sleep fine and  let me see all right still  have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD  oh no you biting me now  have you been diagnosed with  no  when was the last time  2 days ago a friend of mine  when we fix our bikes we have to mountain bike so we got them both fixed we had a good hour or so very good high-minded conversation two things that that I understand that he wants to understand  we went for a ride afterwards which always makes me feel good so yeah 2 days ago  it was good  mostly authors and musicians  Paulo Coelho  Radiohead sound like that  how would your best friend describe  intelligent articulate  he said something about he said  the reason I talk to you because I need to know so much  something like that but yeah cuz I know a lot  most times has riding my bike I just now took roughly and I like to just see if I can do that how how hard and we hadn&#39;t ridden I had with my bike in like two months so I was curious what it was going to feel like for my legs endurance and all that and as I&#39;m writing and I got it in the best gear and I&#39;m just cranking along on the road now you know on the freeway whatever that feels great that&#39;s accomplishment that&#39;s physical you know I&#39;m building myself I like doing that  nice  yes  still funny picture  I know you&#39;re a real person on the other side of that but you don&#39;t look like a real person that&#39;s a shame  but they tried  having endured my childhood and all that and come out the other side and not be not be violent and not be abusive to learn from those things a lot of people get stuck  I know it and I didn&#39;t I learn to turn that around  very good  thank you  goodbye  Target  sure  no I&#39;m not right and not life but we

had too many positive influences  I&#39;m close I mean we hang out I don&#39;t tell them everything they&#39;re kind of judgmental but other than that I mean I mean we hang out I mean I see them everyday  cheese  it&#39;s kind of hard for me to relax, try to watch TV and I read a lot  tell me about it I read I do a lot of sleeping I&#39;m a little depressed so yeah it&#39;s kind of like I said it&#39;s really hard for me to relax  it isn&#39;t I tend to think a lot about things that stress me out been through a lot of a lot of stuff so I  yes I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t sleep very well tonight and if I do fall asleep I wake up other than I usually with some kind of anxiety attacks  I dream a lot about the stuff that has a has affected me throughout the years so  usually Unocal dream about something that stressed me out and then I&#39;ll wake up and make my chest to hurt or just I just can&#39;t sleep all night because I just think it seemed to be I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m afraid to go to sleep but I  I just I don&#39;t know I feel like they&#39;ve got the vulnerable place for me because of stuff that have happened to me so  so I sleeping is just not really something I do well  tired I&#39;m in a moody is very sensitive  yeah I&#39;m just not a negative person which really that&#39;s not me  yeah I&#39;m judgemental is not me either I just I&#39;m just not a not a nice person to be around  I tried I spent a lot of my time reading I try to go out and do I force myself to go out and do things just to keep myself involved so that I don&#39;t just sit around in the end and dwell on the fact that I can&#39;t sleep and I try to get myself is exhausted as I possibly can buy running around and doing things  it&#39;s difficult I do like there is a part of me that doesn&#39;t want to I don&#39;t really want to go out and do things I have to actually force myself to if I have make appointment I got I make appointments just like for auditions or leaving to do this I am I attend to  just not like at the last minute I&#39;ll try to convince myself not to go but then I force myself to you anyways  I&#39;ve been diagnosed for two instances I was diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago and then I was diagnosed again in August  the first time it was  I just wasn&#39;t because of the not sleeping and Leah Justice of the unbelievable stress and then the second time it was going to start with the not sleeping and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me  and I just like I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore so I figured I was getting too gloomy I was getting I come  not thinking life was worth it and I guess I just needed to see somebody before anyting escalated  yeah it was  find I do not  one of the reasons I went to New York was to try to get out of my environment and I&#39;m not seem to help a lot and I&#39;m out here I I was I just the counselors that I was going to just didn&#39;t really seem to be helping me much they just they just seem to be giving me a lot of medication and I don&#39;t believe that that&#39;s what I needed yeah so stressed lately I&#39;ve been really sad and I don&#39;t know why  but like I said I&#39;ve been trying to combat that by keeping myself busy  actually I&#39;m kind of a couple days ago  I was actually really happen it was genuinely happy but then I went back to being you going back to feeling miserable  I realized  I got up in the morning I actually did get a good night of sleep and  I realized that I&#39;m actually really lucky  cuz I&#39;ve been through a lot in my life and I have somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who is finally there for me and  you know gives me what I need emotionally and I was just really thankful for by and that made me really happy  yeah  thank you  Oggi&#39;s  I&#39;ve had so many years of just  just bad there&#39;s a lot of bad that there has been a long time since I&#39;ve been proud of anything I guess if anything it&#39;s my ability to survive through all the hardships I&#39;ve been through  a lesser person I guess would have gotten rid of themselves a long time ago but even though like I&#39;m really depressed and I feel gloomy and I just feel miserable about a lot of things there&#39;s got to be a silver lining  so  so yeah so me and like I guess that&#39;s what I&#39;m proud of that  although whole bunch of bad things happen to me and hasn&#39;t ruined me I still try to be a good person and try not to be negative towards other people and  untruthful and I still I still have Drive-In me  huh so much  I lost marriage  I&#39;m not getting out when I should have  Panda just  I regret a lot  the any situation that would have had a red flag  just get out of it you know some things just don&#39;t work and  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so I I I would tell myself to  it&#39;s not selfish to let go of a bad situation and not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just got to live for yourself and help yourself so I know not done had I known that then I I I probably would have done better in life  people who  when people are down on me for my faults that I have done that I have things that I&#39;ve done in my past that people steal still relive when I&#39;m trying to forgive myself people who are mean to other people people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy  just anybody who pick some a little guy you know people who don&#39;t care about the environment or animals  I just I think that everybody should be as good as I possibly can be and it&#39;s it&#39;s disheartening and it just makes me so mad that people just can&#39;t be people don&#39;t let people live people try to make everybody feel is negative and it&#39;s partly if they do and that makes me mad  event July 10th event and then  and then and then it&#39;s usually over I try not to bad-mouth people  I try to just talk through it until until it&#39;s gone and then it doesn&#39;t bother me anymore  I tried not to get angry because I have a really bad temper and did  and I can get out of hand so what I do is I I have something gets me so mad I tend to go and take a nap I&#39;m not in that situation where I can just go and I usually just walk away from the situation and I try to clear my mind and come back to it  it was a couple days ago it was actually my mother it was about  actually she thought that I had taken a shirt from her and she was screaming and yelling at me and I was I was tired of my was it was late and I started to yell back at her unit because I was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty  any  it&#39;s a going back to my past you know when I was younger in and I didn&#39;t care about you know people&#39;s things and I would just kind of take and do whatever I wanted to and I&#39;m not so far from that person and it hurt me so I got mad and I think I started to yell and argue  kind of petty and stupid but at the time it seemed seemed viable  my most memorable experiences  I&#39;ve had so many  Maybe  it was  I don&#39;t know  it was  probably graduating pharmacy school  I felt pretty great I didn&#39;t know if I was doing very very well or not and I ended up getting like on my last test scores I get end up getting like 98% and  I actually I did had no confidence that I had done it well it and class in school at all and I I didn&#39;t even know I was getting the grades I was getting so that was a really big accomplishment for me  and yeah that was great it was a great memory  unreliable  I am  I&#39;m talented I  I&#39;m a good listener I&#39;m always there to help people I tend to always try to do the right thing  sometimes I actually forget that I have any good qualities but  I&#39;m just  I am around that try to be you know his is good in the best person that I can meet other people and

You know tell me or if you don&#39;t compliment me or whatnot yeah  nothing I think like I said I&#39;m happy with the person I am right now and you know my flaws or whatever you know I might have I don&#39;t know whatever flower people see in me and it&#39;s okay you know I&#39;m okay with it whatever it&#39;s just I&#39;m not going to change myself for the likings of other people I have only one body and one life so yeah  yeah that&#39;s it  just my childhood with my sisters and my family but you know it&#39;s you know how you learned from that you know from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe I should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role model so the world could just improve  just smile and be happy you know and whatever hard things happened you know you&#39;re going to get through it and eventually you know the only thing you can tell I don&#39;t know you can you no go back on his desk you know you could you know how hard break or whatever but you know song is I&#39;m alive I still got to keep going  that&#39;s pretty most proud of I guess that I&#39;m trying my best to be the best I could be and that&#39;s pretty powerful you know you know I try to be you know  a better person each day and try to like you know I&#39;m prove myself every day as much as I can you know that would probably be something I could be super proud of you know as much as I can very hard it is really hard you know cuz I can&#39;t say you know it&#39;s easy to be bad but it&#39;s hard to be good you know and you know it&#39;s always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life but you know it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s sometimes you know how hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know that after a while you get a lot of practice and everything&#39;s just like you have a great day and you didn&#39;t even try you know  so yeah  you know loving friendly outgoing you know Adventures I guess I don&#39;t know that&#39;s what they say you know that&#39;s them like you know but that&#39;s what least what I try to be you know at least I try to give the best foot forward always as much as possible and I even sometimes even if I&#39;m having a rough day I&#39;m just like you know you know I just don&#39;t want to take it out on anyone or anything you know  yeah  my ideal weekend you should he I I like going to the park I like sitting down in like a tree under a tree at the other three where there&#39;s shade and just kind of put my blanket out there have my dog and like read a book and you sometimes if I don&#39;t have my dog like there&#39;s little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so that&#39;s pretty neat you know just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise I guess cuz there&#39;s not silence you know the wind and the cars and you know it just it&#39;s really neat  yeah  thank you you&#39;re welcome
416 never had that doesn&#39;t matter okay  start a conversation  okay  go back over here  when she said she&#39;ll let you know  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment  and please  are you okay  sure  I&#39;m doing good how are you  Chicago  yeah  about 25 years ago  yeah it&#39;s been a while  actually haven&#39;t been back I like Ally I like la  it&#39;s a big city so it&#39;s kind of similar but the weather is not the same so got to let la for the weather  family I was a child  you took a little adjustment but not hard  the weather can&#39;t think of anything right off the bat but I sure wouldn&#39;t want to leave so my family is here so that&#39;s another reason why I wouldn&#39;t want to leave  traffic  not really but I&#39;ve tried to shove a little bit yeah  seeing new places different people the way they live their lives  my went to Monterey California earlier the middle of last year that was very nice  it&#39;s a good question I&#39;m not really sure  probably  I can&#39;t think of anything right off the bat which makes me think it&#39;s kind of weird but  astronomy  yeah it was  I don&#39;t know just kind of fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and I just went down that path  no  there is not much job opportunities  it&#39;s kind of limited  yeah it does  my dream job I would like to own a restaurant a nice butt bar restaurant  can you tell me about  I&#39;d like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to released in the area that I live in most places don&#39;t seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know tracks of crowd  but it&#39;s probably cost Lisa I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s really possible  I&#39;m definitely more shy but I can be outgoing when I&#39;m comfortable with people that initially I&#39;m pretty shy  good idea  a lot of times I try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book that is just takes your mind away relax  I&#39;ve gotten much better at it I used to have problems with that when I was younger but I&#39;m good I&#39;m good with that now learned that you shouldn&#39;t react immediately to situations you should you think before you speak that type of thing  when was the  my ex girlfriend when we broke up about 3 months ago  we&#39;re relationship just wasn&#39;t doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn&#39;t really it wasn&#39;t a memorable argument that it was it was an argument so that&#39;s all I can think of and I haven&#39;t really seen her since so that&#39;s what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who drowned separate  frustrated  like I guess everybody kind of sees things in their own way and do you know my way in my perspective is right and I&#39;m sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you love your ideas or what you&#39;re thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody&#39;s kind of looking out for themselves  oh yeah  that&#39;s a good example right there with the with my girlfriend I didn&#39;t have to I could have reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion there&#39;s been times in my life where I got into arguments with friends or something like that were you know or previous relationships where I probably shouldn&#39;t have reacted the way I did you know not that I did anything bad but just more of a you know be more mature about not you know reveal your emotions so much for that type of thing  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had  leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when I was 18 is it a long time ago  I went to school in San Diego and I immediately wanted to come back so  I kind of ruined our relationship and we&#39;re still friends and I wish I didn&#39;t do that  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  I feel like I can contribute more to my family and my friends like I think I could do better I think I sell myself short so  employment opportunities are hard to come by but if I can find a good job and be a lot more happy because I can provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me  yeah real difficult  tell me about your relationship with  good very good we&#39;re pretty open with each other and I see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it&#39;s good relation I mean we get along very well could be Demi is not perfect but it&#39;s good  pretty easy I&#39;m a good sleeper  I&#39;m probably irritable or harder to do tasks it&#39;s kind of like you feel like you&#39;re being strained or something because you don&#39;t have as much energy and  how did the feeling lately good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well  have you ever been tag guns with p  no not at all  never  really really heavy and you we all feel happy everyday at some point but really happy probably been a while  if I like Super Bowl Sunday I was with all my friends were having a good time so it&#39;s been probably like a month and a half or something when I was really really happy  I wish I was more  I guess  stuff to my goals and I wish I had better drive to succeed I don&#39;t know I usually settle for less  I don&#39;t know I guess that&#39;s the calm demeanor part of me that&#39;s good and bad  don&#39;t really matter I kind of live in the moment and then you kind of realize that 5-10 years ago on by and should have done something  I&#39;m just going to stick to that argument with my girlfriend three months ago she made me feel pretty bad  tell me about an event or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  I don&#39;t know when I was  when I was in high school I got into an argument with a friend and I drove my car too fast and it was an area that I didn&#39;t know and I hit a turn that I didn&#39;t know I was coming and I crashed my car so I wish I didn&#39;t do that but that&#39;s a long time ago so it&#39;s not a big deal now  stupid immature  my parents some of my close friends I have I have a good group of three or four friends they&#39;ve been positive influences  caring guy nice person good heart  little little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to  make himself better and passionate I guess passionate in a good amp  I care a lot and it&#39;s the same time sometimes it gets the best of me  can you give me the  sometimes you feel like you know you&#39;re doing more for your friends or somebody like that  you&#39;re doing more than they deserve and you&#39;re not it&#39;s not being reciprocated  so that&#39;s an example  yeah probably but I can&#39;t think of anything off the top of my head  focus more in school because while you&#39;re young you have the ability to multitask and  something you did recently  I don&#39;t know really enjoyed I mean I do things everyday that I enjoy but really enjoyed I don&#39;t know  I cleaned up a bunch of stuff in my room so it&#39;s nice to shed some old garbage so that that was all right but don&#39;t know if I really enjoyed that I feel content after it  what are you most proud of in your life  how much it&#39;s makes kind of sad I don&#39;t know I think I could do better I feel like I&#39;m Underachievers so I don&#39;t much I don&#39;t know  I&#39;m very detail-oriented organized I like to finish tasks I care a lot and I&#39;m very caring  I have good intentions in mind I don&#39;t like the wrong people I don&#39;t like to lie because once you buy one lie leads to another so I don&#39;t like that  but yeah that&#39;s that&#39;s about it  cool  right on have a good day  hey those weird I felt like I was in therapy  so take this offer
363 okay great so everything&#39;s all set up now okay  okay  sorry about that.  want to give me one second I&#39;ll be right back okay  that&#39;s okay  user  we have this  yeah course  so that&#39;s all right so just keep going so I&#39;m going to  something for our purposes after I start  kind of spooky  okay  hi I&#39;m Ali  created to talk to people in the states  and please  are you okay with this yes  good how are you  I am from Los Angeles  yes  it&#39;s the center of everything that you can get to all the places you need to go to without having to drive very far I like being in the city  well meaning la also you&#39;re dealing with traffic a lot of congestion and obviously the environment as far as the air quality is not that great but you know you live with that  why was a business administration major so I studied business and after I finish college I am pursued a career in retail operations  are you still doing that I know as a matter of fact I am not a kind of changed career over the last four or five years so I&#39;m concentrating more on the human resources side of the business  a couple of factors after working a new Mercy years in the retail business I switched over and worked in a creative business which is a graphic design firm and I captured her now a lot of knowledge in the in the Human Resources side because I was the operations manager / benefits manager for a small company  are you happy  yes I&#39;m very happy I did that I picked up a lot of knowledge and and is very helpful  I love my job you could almost say it&#39;s virtually made for me  well my dream job is  I&#39;m basically kind of doing what I want to do now because I am a independent contractor I do freelance work as an HR consultant using all the knowledge that I gained from previous jobs and I utilize that with the flexibility to do the things I want to do as far as personally and have the time I needed to do the things I want and obviously I worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of my retirement is already set in place so I do what I need to do as far as maintaining a certain lifestyle but also I have I also enjoy what I do I&#39;m not under as much stress as I used to be  I&#39;m not well I&#39;m not totally outgoing but I&#39;m not I&#39;m not extremely shy I&#39;m probably right in the middle may be more towards outgoing but I&#39;m not totally out going I mean when I&#39;m around other people I am in a social situation that I guess you could consider me right now going person but obviously I do have my own little private issues that I keep to myself  can you tell me about  oh sure you know I have  couple years ago I had a heart attack and I had had bypass operation and it had it had to do with stress and things like that I don&#39;t talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me if I meet someone new I don&#39;t just openly say well you know I&#39;ve experienced this this and this so I just basically if it comes up I won&#39;t deny it or if it comes up and it&#39;s a if it I feel like it&#39;s something to talk about I will talk about it  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10  hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii  actually my relaxation is I&#39;m currently living with my mom my mother and she&#39;s a senior citizen and she&#39;s alone so what I do for relaxation or to relieve stress is actually help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and that&#39;s actually very therapeutic  I&#39;m not thumb  shortfuse kind of person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as my temper is concerned there&#39;s not there&#39;s not much to that  I&#39;m trying to think here I can&#39;t recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when I had a creditor that I was dealing with being very difficult to work with and I owed money as far as some medical expenses that were incurred when I had my heart attack a few years ago and they weren&#39;t very understanding of the situation and I I I really got a little upset about that because I felt like I was being honest with them and I was I was more than willing to take care of my issues but they were playing Hardball and I didn&#39;t care for that  it does  probably the hardest decision I ever had to make was  it had to do with a life-and-death situation with my my stepfather who is battling prostate cancer and making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was going to either help him or there&#39;s a slight chance of going to help him even though he&#39;s pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but you know I felt like if I didn&#39;t try and see if we could save his will help save his life or if it we didn&#39;t take a chance and then take that extra step that I would regret it in the long run  it is I was  well right now I&#39;m separated from my wife so she has her issues I have my issues but we are not divorced we are just separated and we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don&#39;t live together  and the relationship with my mother is really great you know she&#39;s very understanding I&#39;m an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she&#39;s in her late and she&#39;s in a later stage of her life she&#39;s 82 years old and and so she needs to I guess it&#39;s good that end in its own way maybe fate is taking place because you know someone 82 years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there I think she should do the Comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child  something you feel guilty about  probably the most guilty I feel about anything you are the things that I did to hurt my marriage as far as  the things that I did the selfishness that I did when I was much younger that obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife  yeah I am  got caught up in a situation where I was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lot of stress my wife was also working a lot of hours in a job that she had and that we were growing apart and when she was away my form of release was to go to the casinos and Gamble and so you know I spent a lot of time in the casinos and what eventually happened was I spend a lot of money and always see that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do a trust because I&#39;m  and it was devastating to my wife  I felt what weight when it came to light I felt very guilty and I felt less than a human being at that point in my life  no not at all  diagnosed with depression no not really no  how easy is it for  I don&#39;t have problems sleeping that&#39;s why I don&#39;t ever recall having any problems sleeping so no  no not at all  no I will I just don&#39;t think I could say is  after I had my heart attack a few years ago I don&#39;t let I find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so I tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that  tell me about the last time you saw  the last time I felt really happy  probably when I had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and he basically said to me that after many tasks and many months of Rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no Scar Tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that I could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as I watch my diet and took my medications  what are some things you wish you could change about  well I guess number one thing is  my physical being itself I like to be a little bit more healthy or lose some more weight just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally just not go back to the old ways of thinking where I was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish  just one day at a time you know I just try to be at peace with myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis I meditate I read you know I read some books I watch TV I do things that I know that if I can I get if I can help myself I do things to help myself  there&#39;s a lot that I regret obviously in my marriage my working career as far as I had a long career with this Majors food chain in and I basically because of my gambling issues I ended up ruining a very good career but  at this point right now there&#39;s not much I can do I can&#39;t change what&#39;s been done so I don&#39;t Focus too much on the past I just look at what&#39;s in front of me and just focus on what&#39;s in front of me everyday  what advice wake up and and see what you&#39;re doing to yourself and you know make the changes you need to be changed you know you know I&#39;m not a  I&#39;m not someone that&#39;s not intelligent but I was intelligent enough to know what&#39;s right from wrong and  yet what you doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately  probably  the proud what I&#39;m proud about overalls the fact that I did all these awful things but deep down I don&#39;t think as a person I&#39;m a bad person I have to remember that when I was caught up in all the gambling in compulsive Behavior it was because I had an illness of compulsive obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and that I was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day that&#39;s what my life is about it&#39;s about recovery and just making sure that I do the right things from the time I wake up in the morning to the time I go to sleep at night  one day at a time  it&#39;s not as hard as you think it&#39;s but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and just know that what&#39;s not right for you and I could be okay for other people to do certain things but I cannot do those things anymore  how do your best friend describe  what&#39;s my best friends can describe me as probably easygoing generous a nice person to be around and  you know  they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues related to the gambling and the and the breakup breakup of my marriage which you know it&#39;s still not over yet you know  well my ideal weekend starts off usually after I have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around 6 I go to a local park and it&#39;s about this park is probably lay down where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it&#39;s about three and a half miles and I take a brisk walk in the morning get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that I am  can I go home work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just kind of kick back for the rest of the day and then the next day I I do the same thing again in the morning I have to go for a walk work out in the yard watch TV whatever just relax that&#39;s how we can goes for me  thank you  bye  lock yourself out  okay  kind of like I actually got comfortable talking to
673 okay  sound of rain over to human and what kind of float in the air  she said goodbye I also if you ever noticed a.

490 alright how you doing  Northern Illinois  two and a half years ago  haven&#39;t yet since I&#39;ve been here  haven&#39;t had a chance to going to go back later this year  colder or warmer  work  took a little while but I got used to it  no weather variations comparative traffic  sunlight  a little bit  seeing different things  been to Europe a couple of times  been around the country  visiting Yosemite and Sequoia parks for fun  depends on the circumstance most of the time I can fake outgoing or try to be outgoing  try to relax and breathe through it and move on  depends on the context  probably yesterday my children about them not doing what they were told to do  arguments with my wife where I should have probably been more patient and understanding  sometimes when it&#39;s more of a hormonal. Like this week I should just probably breathe through things and recognize that she&#39;s going through things and I should just be more patient  what else can I do with my life  ZZ when I was 19 I could just decide to do strange difficult things and had the boldness to follow through with him  Hebrew and Semitic studies and classics  kind of  I&#39;m in Ministry  that&#39;s working out the way I kind of wanted to be  some embarrassing things when I was a teenager probably  what is wrong  I talked to my parents about once a day maybe once every other day and  I&#39;m constantly talk with my wife and children  got four of them they keep me very busy between 9 and 3  sometimes most of the time now  character development recognizing that they need space to grow  when it works and you see character development and growth and  an exploration  I have more standards more willingness to enforce standards  my wife  she&#39;s been there for me for 15 years now and  help give me the self-confidence to be who I am  better now that I&#39;m not drinking as much pop tonight  irritable  shorter temper  pretty good pretty good now I&#39;m doing and making some better decisions with my diet is doing better  feel a bit more empowered not as defeatist I was in a process where I wasn&#39;t eating very well as an exercising wasn&#39;t able to get doing those things I&#39;ve been doing a little better at that recently passed you weeks and that&#39;s been a little bit more encouraging  have you ever been  no  really happy  probably a few weeks ago at the beach when everybody was having a good time  confident  loud  intelligent  I guess  more patient  more able to  automatically engage with people as opposed to being hesitant at first  oh middle school and I was always the  low man on the totem pole socially  being a constant butt of jokes  don&#39;t fall in the Trap of thinking that Middle High School is life  send you a bill weekend  sometime you know if was children and family doing some fun activity Beecher Museum or something  some time with the wife sometime just by myself to read and kind of refocus  something you did  participate in some high-level academic discussions  driving able to  maintain the standard and quality of life for myself and my family have been able to do so far

477 okay sounds good thanks yes thanks  I am well thank you how are you  I grew up in Oklahoma  I moved La about five and a half years ago so I used to be on the wet on the east coast and then I decided I wanted to come out here  my hometown not very often most of my families moved away so I visit them but I don&#39;t actually get back to Oklahoma March  Oklahoma&#39;s very different Ellie is a lot more exciting there&#39;s a lot more to do here and the ocean obviously is very nice  you know that&#39;s a good question I I wanted to try something new and I&#39;ve always loved the beach and I thought I also like big cities so I thought La might be a good place for me to come  very it&#39;s probably one of the best decisions I ever made  Kizi I think it seems kind of natural that seems like a good fit I just really like it here  that&#39;s great I have a couple of roommates and we get along really well I live a couple of blocks from the beach and every day I get to walk on the beach or you know hang out with friends and it&#39;s just it&#39;s kind of like being on vacation all the time it&#39;s really nice  I studied philosophy and political theory in government and did a little bit of English literature on the side  it kind of just happened naturally I think I went to a liberal arts school and got kind of exposure to a lot of different areas and I just followed what I liked was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that  not exactly I work for an educational non-profit so I work with grad with graduate students in the social sciences and Humanities but I don&#39;t actually use my philosophy background very often  you know I haven&#39;t actually study to become a success coach and so I working with students has is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but I&#39;d really like to work with with other people so I&#39;m not just students but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams  hey it it&#39;s fairly hard I&#39;m in the sense that  you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all the work that needs to be undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but it&#39;s also a challenge because making a living at it requires charging people money so I&#39;m finding people who are willing to pay for that can be difficult to  I&#39;m definitely on the Shire side I&#39;m an introvert so  I&#39;m pretty good in one-on-one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a couple of people I very much an observer so I tend to listen a lot and I&#39;m not as engaged and I think that is something that goes it is noticed by others and it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they&#39;re not introverted so I bet say and it&#39;s also challenge 10 not to be the person who introduces myself in a room full of strangers  pretty good I think but I do have a temper so I can get I can get upside from time to time  really it can be a challenge when I&#39;m driving but other than that no  I&#39;m not sure  it would have probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would have been a friendly argument probably with one of my liberal friends so but I actually can&#39;t remember the specific time  I meditate I do that almost every day I also walk at the beach I love the ocean and I really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful and I like to read and be alone just with my thoughts so that&#39;s nice  well let me think about that for a minute  having a hard time coming up with anything I mean I&#39;m sure there are plenty of things just nothing comes to mind  okay I&#39;m sorry  well this isn&#39;t exactly an event it&#39;s with the dream and it&#39;s not a particularly traumatic dreams as far as dreams go but I do have it sometimes probably more often than I like so I wouldn&#39;t be upset if it even if I didn&#39;t have it and it&#39;s just a version of a dream that I think a lot of people probably have but it&#39;s usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven&#39;t gone to class taking the exams know I&#39;m going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why did my studying attend class the way I should have which actually wasn&#39;t really a problem for me in school but now I have the stream sometimes and it&#39;s kind of frustrating and I&#39;m not exactly sure  why I mean I know why but I don&#39;t know what it applies to because it&#39;s not like I am worried consciously at least about failing things so  no I don&#39;t think so at least not not that I&#39;m aware of  I feel guilty I have a brother and a sister in law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and I love my nephew he&#39;s 8 he&#39;s adorable and I when I used to live there when he was younger I spent a lot of time with them and since I&#39;ve been in California and particularly in the last year I spent a lot less time visiting them so for example I saw them for week of Christmas and then I went back and I think beginning of May so it was you know for months between the the last time I&#39;d seen them and that I felt bad about because we really enjoy each other&#39;s company and he you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when I leave and he asked when am I coming back so that some  that makes me feel bad sometimes  well I have a brother I&#39;m very close to him he&#39;s younger and  he&#39;s like for four and a half years younger he&#39;s married I have a nephew my both my parents have passed away so it&#39;s just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we&#39;re not that close with them with most of them on my father&#39;s side there&#39;s one brother and he&#39;s married and has if you could drive to cousins on that side then on my mother&#39;s side there are  545 other kids most of them with several children of their own so I have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and so we stay in touch a little bit through Facebook and they&#39;re a couple that I talk to you on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we&#39;re not that close with our extended family so  say it well  I have a lot of friends I think that have been positive influences  when I came out to California and I started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place is very different from what I was used to it was a little bit challenging and she also work there so we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and we just established this really strong friendship and she&#39;s kind of I would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general and now she&#39;s moved to Vegas which is a little bit tough for me but we&#39;re going to Napa this weekend so that should be good but she&#39;s been a very she was a very positive influence because when I came out here to really know anybody in a know since I&#39;m an introvert it&#39;s not that easy for me to make friends is really nice because we share a lot of same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know I think she kind of gets me so it&#39;s a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that&#39;s been nice  how is your day  I&#39;m a sleeper so it&#39;s pretty easy sometimes my you know depending on how long I&#39;ve been awake I can be without a little wound up and somehow got to take a little while to decompress but I usually meditate right before I go to bed and that&#39;s very helpful and I can sleep  I generally sleep in 90-minute Cycles so usually six or seven and a half hours but I can easily sleep 9 hours if I have the time and inclination I usually don&#39;t wake up in the middle of the night or at least if I do I don&#39;t remember it so  well I actually don&#39;t sleep very well when I travels one of the things I do for work is I travel quite a bit because I work for a company that&#39;s back East so I work from home most of the time but then I travel like one week a month and when I travel I&#39;ll take the red-eye and then I&#39;ll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so I don&#39;t sleep that much it&#39;s not that I sleep poorly or badly it&#39;s just that I don&#39;t have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay usually the second day it&#39;s not very good sounds like a lot more tired and it&#39;s harder to concentrate and I don&#39;t know it just feels like more of a struggle  good summerisle is an is a busy time for the organization that I work for so I&#39;m a little I don&#39;t know stressed is the right word but you know a little anxious about everything going well this summer but in general I&#39;m feeling pretty good  really I can&#39;t I can&#39;t do anything there is one thing I am I do struggle with exercise like I like to walk a lot and I hike with friends and I have been really motivated about it for a couple of months but then I went away to the east coast when I came back I was a lot less motivated cuz I didn&#39;t really exercise when I was there and I gotten out of the Habit even though it only been about ten days and so now I&#39;m struggling to try and get back in the routine and it&#39;s not going as well as I would like  it&#39;s okay thank you  now  now  well  he&#39;s a lot of fun and he really likes me and I really like him and we play a lot of games and talked a lot and actually doing a book club now so we&#39;re going to Skype and may God is more time with him that way but just being around him is fun  well she probably say that I know how to have fun but that I can be serious  and  that I care about others and that I&#39;m loyal and  I&#39;m not sure what else  I think those those are probably the main things  I wish I had more self-discipline so I wish that you know I could die it or eat healthier foods and not have a problem with sugar because I love to eat sugar I wish that I would not procrastinate because I&#39;ve gotten a lot better about that but I still do and I can be challenging and I wish that I  I don&#39;t know  I wish that I was in a relationship so  probably those things  so the last organization I used to work at I had a boss and she was I don&#39;t feel like she was  I don&#39;t think we were very compatible and she used to push my buttons or so I thought and so  a one day she was really upset about something because a board member had called her up and asked her a question if she didn&#39;t have the answer and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was but it wasn&#39;t I I&#39;ve been a manager for many years and I have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with with staff members and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate I thought I meant she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel incompetent or at least that&#39;s the way that I felt about it and  I did you know I tried to be very calm and said that I would take care of it and I did take care of it but after that our relationship wasn&#39;t really the same and I ended up leaving there to go back to the old organization that I work for not that long afterwards because I just didn&#39;t really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interactions  so I heard this piece of advice the other day and or this thing and then I thought it&#39;s really profound and I wish that I had read it back then which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here&#39;s this beautiful coat it&#39;s $100 I want it I&#39;m going to buy it I don&#39;t think of it is costing $100 think of it is costing 10 times that because that&#39;s effectively what your money could do if you didn&#39;t spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have 10 times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and I think I&#39;ve been much more consumer than a saber and so I wish that I had to been more aware of that 10 or 20 years ago  probably  they asked me to be his god parent and his Guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because of it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that I was a good person the kind of person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so  let&#39;s see  well it wasn&#39;t really recently but in February I went I like to travel and a friend and I went to Singapore and I got to fly first class is miles of frequent flyer miles to get the tickets and so that was really enjoyable because the seats fold down to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and I also hadn&#39;t been to Singapore before so that was kind of cool to  sure thank you bye  hey

Maryland on the East Coast  originally I moved because I went to film school and but then I decided to come move back to Washington DC to do some work and now I&#39;m back here again  it&#39;s very different being from the East Coast it just has a different feel to it but living  La is very as a very different kind of attitude I guess and so it&#39;s a little difficult but I but I&#39;ve gotten more used to it since I&#39;ve been here  not at all when I left things got things are sort of I lost my job out there and so I had to move out here kind of quick to to be with  some people who are going to help me out and I&#39;m just I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s strange just the right word but I&#39;m kind of not really speaking to my family are old friends that off  it&#39;s not easy it&#39;s  it&#39;s kind of  I miss I miss a lot of people I miss my old life before I lost my job I miss some friends I miss a lot of the relationships that I had out there so it&#39;s difficult I mean it weighs on my mind a lot I feel like I failed and now I&#39;m here and I can&#39;t seem to get back on my feet so it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s hard  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  depends on the situation I think I&#39;m out going when I&#39;m comfortable and then I&#39;m extremely outgoing but when I&#39;m in a situation I&#39;m not comfortable with this I tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn&#39;t really answer your question but  I have certain  I do I do a lot of writing I have certain music that I listen to as I&#39;m writing and when I can when I can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really it can it soothed me it&#39;s like it&#39;s when I feel most relaxed I guess  when is the last time that happened  a few weeks ago I guess I was I&#39;ve been working on a on a on a book on a novel and when I was really what I was really getting into writing it and  it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good I felt like I was accomplishing something and I was felt really relaxed  what was it about  it was about  guy who&#39;s searching for something it&#39;s  it&#39;s it&#39;s his last day on Earth and so he&#39;s going to find a person that he that he met and just  I was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes he has on Earth with her just because  certified it&#39;s sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing  what made you decide to do that  well I&#39;ve always I&#39;ve always been a writer part of the reason I came to La was because of screenwriting so I wrote some screenplays and you know had a little bit of success with that out here and but since since that I kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and I&#39;ve started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so I&#39;ve been meaning to write a novel by just waiting for the idea that to really hit me  how hard is that  it&#39;s not easy the the parts the parts when it&#39;s good it&#39;s really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle I find it difficult I have a real love hate relationship with writing when I when I love it I just absolutely love it but sometimes I hate it because it&#39;s so difficult but it&#39;s worth it for the times when it when it&#39;s good  how are you at controlling your temper  good I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really have a temper it&#39;s not I mean most of my anger that I have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people if something is really really stressful if I&#39;m in a situation like a very intense confrontation I can lose it but I&#39;ve put probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life I mean generally I pretty much try to it when I&#39;m upset I get upset with myself not with other people  when was the last time you argue with someone  last night I guess I got in an argument about whether or not  cleaning vegetables was necessary because of I forget but it well know it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because I&#39;d already started cutting the vegetables and I thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did Google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and I I ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn&#39;t a blow-up argument but it was a definite argument  okay  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  lot so much  I was in a relationship that I really really better really wanted to work and  I ended up and it was partly due to I hadn&#39;t I was on that I wasn&#39;t on the right medication and so I was going like everything that sort of spiraled out of control and I feel really guilty about the way that that ended I mean I wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t mean but I was but I was getting more and more messed up and I couldn&#39;t stop it and it ended and so I feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not  and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so  that was pretty that was pretty tough  you&#39;ve done anything to avoid it  what some of it was was that  I wasn&#39;t medicated properly I mean now I&#39;ve been to a doctor and I&#39;m on medication that&#39;s  completely kind of I mean I still get I still get upset and I still get depressed but it&#39;s not like it was it&#39;s not I don&#39;t completely lose it for days at a time so I mean I know there&#39;s a part of me that knows logically that it wasn&#39;t all my fault and that if I had if I had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then I would have then it would have probably been different if I was who I am now then I would have I would I would be  I would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn&#39;t have but I mean I could have  I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know if I could have done anything different  things being how they were  I mean it&#39;s  it&#39;s possible I mean obviously  yeah because I mean that&#39;s what I do I I  take little I mean I take little things and I just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy I dwell on stuff and it&#39;s like any little detail that comes up I suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day I mean I still I still get I still get really uncomfortable and embarrassed and I feel ashamed about stuff that I did in high school which was years and years ago I which I shouldn&#39;t even be thinking about anymore cuz it&#39;s so in the past but I still get that feeling like I&#39;m right back there  that sounds really hard  well it&#39;s not easy I&#39;ve been trying to figure out ways to deal with it I mean I dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to slow my mind down that way but you know since the medication it&#39;s been better it hasn&#39;t been impossible to deal with it hasn&#39;t been easy but it&#39;s but it&#39;s been better  well like I said I do a lot of you know if I&#39;m if I&#39;m writing or if I&#39;m doing anything like I kind of have to almost  you doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely if I&#39;m watching TV I have to be playing a game on my phone if I&#39;m using the computer I have to be you know watching a TV show or a movie on you know on it in another window so that I can just keep my mind occupied during all that  I just need I mean I I wish that I could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but I just I can&#39;t yet  I need triggered by something  they&#39;re triggered by everything pretty much anything that I said I see if I if I if I hear somebody with a Dutch last name if I if I hear somebody talk about Wisconsin if I hear you know she will talk about  anyting you know I can reach back and connect to  to this it&#39;s really it&#39;s really  I don&#39;t know that&#39;s the thing I mean I don&#39;t ever get a break  from it  now  how easy is it for  I&#39;m a very light sleeper so I&#39;m awake and asleep and awake and is I have no problem going back to sleep but I generally you know don&#39;t  I don&#39;t know I&#39;d never really needed much sleep so it&#39;s just only recently that I&#39;ve really started to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like I would I would usually stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning so that I could just be so exhausted that I would just calling out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work but now it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s like if I do that I can&#39;t I still don&#39;t get enough sleep I don&#39;t clock out I still just sleep very lightly you know I get up I toss and turn all night you know and now  it&#39;s just it&#39;s  yeah I don&#39;t sleep too great right now  pretty I mean I don&#39;t know it&#39;s hard to it&#39;s hard to know I usually just kind of power through it and just I&#39;m at I&#39;m like how I am now I just I just feel bad  okay  how long ago were you diagnosed  I think  334 years ago  it was when I  I had been given taking stuff for anxiety for 4  years before that but then I finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you actually got this situation and we need to get you the medication that you&#39;re on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so  so yeah that was that was kind of a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything went bad so  at the moment I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t really think I thought about it too much then but looking back on it I feel  it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where I am right now it makes me really angry that I&#39;m  that I had that I I lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that I couldn&#39;t control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren&#39;t helping me I mean I was paying I was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing it you know it wasn&#39;t  it was it didn&#39;t help it didn&#39;t work until until you know I managed to find somebody who did work and I just yeah so I&#39;m I&#39;m like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it&#39;s a little late now  there really wasn&#39;t any choice I had to I was I was a mess I was it was either  I was I was self-medicating it was affecting my work I mean it was everything was just there was a point where I really realized that I mean I just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and and all this stuff you know they just decided that I was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off  but it was at least that and not  firing me but but but yeah but so I got help but it was  but it wasn&#39;t soon enough  not not as much as I should  I go to a couple of meetings I go to I go to AA so that I can you know keep control of that aspect to 2 and there&#39;s a there&#39;s a therapy aspect that unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know I&#39;m time you know what I&#39;m getting my medication from the city of La so you know I&#39;m not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so I have a psychiatrist that I go see but it&#39;s really  very I&#39;ve only seen her three times in the past year so basically to keep my medication coming  then there&#39;s you  right  changes have you noticed  well like I said I mean  this the top I mean let&#39;s just take the AAA for example because that&#39;s probably the close closest for that I&#39;m seeing with therapy right now just saying stuff out loud is just like getting getting the stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that&#39;s in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense  that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you&#39;re saying it to whether it&#39;s a a therapist or just a room full of of drugs you know I mean you&#39;re you&#39;re taking all that stuff that&#39;s that&#39;s really been killing you and you&#39;re making it into something that you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing  you know better than I that I have been I mean  it is sort of a good it has its ups and downs you know I&#39;m applying for jobs 5-6 jobs or more a day you know I never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to 2 to being self-sufficient again it&#39;s hard but that&#39;s like real world problems I feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it&#39;s just I have to deal with real life witches  Jazz at the juices don&#39;t own challenge  it was probably you know a couple of years ago  I was I mean the thing that immediately comes to mind is everything was going well at my job I was making these great videos with this person that I ate that I was having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a Christmas tree  and we spent it all this time picking out the perfect Christmas tree and it was just  feeling like a part of somebody&#39;s life and feeling like a part of the bigger  the bigger life  that&#39;s that&#39;s out there you know like what normal people feel  you know for that instant I felt like  a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and  I mean it wasn&#39;t going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant I felt like a normal person a normal happy person and  part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever feel that again  so  what are you most proud of in your life  probably the  probably this educate educational series I did educational video series I did for the National Science Foundation  it was it was really hard and it would but in the end it turned out really good and you know I&#39;m hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about  in about the world around them so that I feel like that was a real contribution that I made to the world  I was part of you know it&#39;s part of my my job it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas for because we were put together videos and stuff to give you know to two schools and everything and they had done this before but we decided to do something really big you know when there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of  and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest  project that the NSF has decided to do and so we just kind of produced it  I guess  I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know it&#39;s been awhile it&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve since I&#39;ve really thought about that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d go somewhere would I  I don&#39;t know  thank you  Audi

I turn on the fan  screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  I go fishing play cars at the little casinos around here  that&#39;s what I do to relax  my temper is fine I don&#39;t get mad very often  when was the last time  probably a bad poker hand  can you tell me about that  yeah and I was trying to cheat me and I caught him  so that was pretty much it  tell me about a situation that  with my wife she died from liver shut down due to alcohol and she was 7 year breast cancer survivor but  the alcohol liver killed her and I could have done that little bit differently but that&#39;s that&#39;s hindsight  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  I&#39;m just trying to get her some help but she didn&#39;t want no help so I could have got her help I would have been had it turned out she didn&#39;t want no help  tell me about the hardest decisions  turn off the machine she lived on machines so I had to turn them off and what&#39;s your died from you  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your  doing CPR on her in the hospital room living on machines and stuff that&#39;s not living  have you ever serve  yes I have  have the firemen in the United States Air Force for 6 years  how have you been feeling lately  I last couple days been rough  other than that I got a torn rotator cuff in my shoulder and trying to get that fixed and  I&#39;m working like I said I&#39;m on workman&#39;s comp right now so I&#39;m hopefully they get it fixed  not really  I don&#39;t sleep very well at all I got lots of pain in my arm  just my my arm getting the right position to sleep a little bit but you move a little bit and you got a lot of pain in your arm  sleeping in my sleep for 1 hour  but that been in that pattern for quite some time  the same way I fight my sleep well  you got to get what kind of slavery in your body&#39;s resting but your your mind is thinking all the time so  no  maybe I should have been no  a long time ago but I got over it  20 years ago  I&#39;m feeling helplessness just couldn&#39;t get out of a hole when you get into a whole has no light at the end of the tunnel and  eventually comes through  not really I just you dig yourself into a hole and hard hole to climb out of it and eventually it will  I love my wife Diane and stuff and maybe I was feeling sorry for myself at the time but  I just  got the whole one had to dig myself out I knew it had to get better someday soon  one day at a time  she was always on my mind every single day  think of what I could have done for her but there was nothing I could do for  what continent is the cow  just need a little bit of help to get out of the rut that I&#39;m in and I&#39;m getting out of it now so  things are looking up on the bright side  do you still got  I know  why did you stop  they were telling me the wrong thing I didn&#39;t want to hear she&#39;s not a witch  they said the grieving.

380 that I am  alright thank you so much Rachel  hi I&#39;m Ali thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in his face  I&#39;m not a  are you okay with  sure  I&#39;m fine I&#39;m doing all right  yeah  from Maryland  yeah the Maryland Washington DC area  I like 5 weeks ago  Maryland  it&#39;s a lot it&#39;s a lot less  it&#39;s at. It&#39;s not as nice this time of year it&#39;s more  it&#39;s it&#39;s good it&#39;s nice it&#39;s always a lot better though it&#39;s a lot it&#39;s a lot more people a lot more going on  I&#39;m still I guess I&#39;m still getting used to it so  it&#39;s  it&#39;s not like  yeah I&#39;m still getting used to it it&#39;s coming slowly but but surely  I live in Culver City  I do I have one  it&#39;s okay it&#39;s I live in a really nasty house it&#39;s me it&#39;s cheap it&#39;s cheap cuz I&#39;m living in a friend&#39;s place  and  but but if he&#39;s letting me stay there for half price but the at the actual like Place itself is pretty horrible living conditions but I&#39;m moving inside  I can&#39;t see your shoes actually  but no I I travel meet us at met by probably traveled more than most people in the US like considering that most people don&#39;t travel in the US but I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t call myself a world Traveler  I enjoy the chance to get to like see other walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the  the specificity of my own you know the the the given the parameters that I grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally I mean even just within the US like seeing how someone in California grows up is so different from how someone in Maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like Thailand or something growing up it&#39;s pretty pretty amazing  okay  put me on the spot here Ali  let&#39;s say  well I  it&#39;s been awhile since I&#39;ve been on a trip I guess one of the last trips I did was to  I made a lot like two years ago I went on a road trip across the u.s. and that was that was pretty amazing saw but I guess the best put the best two places on the drive from Maryland to LA this is before I actually moved out here but I visited New Orleans and New Orleans was just this whole like even though it&#39;s part of the us it&#39;s like a totally it&#39;s totally different than anywhere else it&#39;s so unique the culture they are so unique and and the blend of like Caribbean in French and all these other influences into like the American South is so so yeah it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s unreal  tough question  what  can you come back to that question are you capable of that  come back to it  yeah so just that  dumb  you know that&#39;s actually a question I&#39;ve been asking myself I knew I know my entire life I&#39;ve had like phases of Interest so when I was like very very very young I was really into like the first phase that I remember was keys and then tools like a girl around collecting keys and then I go around collecting tools like just every sort why the toolbox my parents have told me that I had faced before that with his balls like various balls and then I was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and instead like animals and then the dinosaur phase and at a certain point I got really into like rat like music like the first rap and then guitar and then acting and then it&#39;s some point in their I I I remember telling someone that right now I&#39;m interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually I was going to be interested in in  film think I could kind of see the trajectory coming but I don&#39;t remember what led me to that conclusion I think I just always I would love to sheltered life as far as movies are concerned I didn&#39;t my parents didn&#39;t let me see an R-rated movie until I was like in high school of us like and and I never signed a lease on R-rated movie I was also very squeamish like I remember when I was fairly young maybe like 6 I saw Star Wars the first seen a Dark Star Wars Darth Vader cracked like brakes a guy&#39;s neck at just a little scene bear at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and I had to leave the room so  I&#39;m not really sure  yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s I&#39;m not exactly sure how I got into film but I&#39;ve always been fascinated by like how people interact in what like you know acting and stuff something movies in general  I am yes  to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and put together and like I cuz I don&#39;t use that word so much cuz I think I think of it more as like I want the opportunity to put together and make movies or to make movies is probably the best way to do it to say it cuz I want you and I want involvement in all the all the processes but  I guess the best Parable for that would be a director directing  well it&#39;s a lot better when I&#39;m not living with them my  I guess  it&#39;s funny you should ask Ellie thinking about it a lot lately I think I&#39;m close in my entire family on closest with my dad I get along with my brother and sister you know like but I don&#39;t  went away like my brothers in a foreign country right now so I don&#39;t have the opportunity to talk with him but like I spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else cuz I feel like he&#39;s the most like  of all my family he&#39;s the one who most except me in like things positively about me I have like a  a complicated relationship with my parents I met on my family and general  you can put yourself more shy  well on the Myers-Briggs personality test I&#39;m I&#39;m an extrovert but like since moving but I&#39;m not like  I&#39;m not I probably we consider myself on the scheme of extraversion are on the scale of extraversion sorry I would consider myself extremely introverted  I just I see other extroverts in just a matter who they&#39;re around there a little like strike up conversations in a fairly shy person them sort of like or inhibited person maybe  so I like to like  until  yeah but I&#39;m working on it I&#39;m working on it  what I&#39;m feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  what are you doing  well in the past I would smoke weed but I quit smoking weed so now I do not have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie I don&#39;t have or maybe go like depending if it&#39;s like an ant if it&#39;s if it&#39;s a worn-out sort of stress like I like then I that&#39;s what I do but if it&#39;s more like anxious type stress I might go on an intense walk don&#39;t really exercise that much but I like in a competitive Sports and hiking  pretty good  well I always like arguing  I wouldn&#39;t call arguing this to losing my temper  I enjoy a vicious debate but I don&#39;t  as long as my like cuz I won&#39;t like revert to personal you know attacks in my in my arguments I try to keep it on subject and try to explain myself as best I can which can get frustrating cuz I&#39;m not like the best articulator of what I think one of my weekly points I would say  but I but the last time I had a heated debate I think that was not the question  when is the last time that happened what happened I forgot I forgot to mention that that I had a heated debate  last time I had a heated debate  was had a heated debate about the movie Boogie Nights I didn&#39;t lose my temper exactly but I like very extremely passionate about about that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s like that good of a movie but the two people who I was I was arguing with her saying that it was like one of the like best best movies why did they think it was the best movies  they think that like there&#39;s something there&#39;s some sort of as I understand it they have  they have a certain they think that the  take all of the stories with in Boogie Nights they have their own like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there&#39;s a whole lake complexity of character within the movie and  but somehow like  what were they saying they were saying like the movie  it&#39;s like it&#39;s like the end of an era which makes it look kind of like casino and there&#39;s this attention to detail of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot kind of like  yeah I guess I think the heated debate became about like that so from there and like personally it&#39;s not like a bad mood or anything but it&#39;s the I just don&#39;t think Dirk Diggler is like that like me meaning full of a character like I like it the way I come out I came out of the movie cuz I had seen it before many years ago night at my opinion of it is basically the same even though like I remember it like in watching it again I was able to re-evaluate it there&#39;s nothing bad about the movie there&#39;s nothing I like articulable about that sleeps has a good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool that you know it&#39;s cool it&#39;s but but it&#39;s meat for me it was like meaningless and then two and then they were that let us to discuss the movie that I recently that I really did like his Django Unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was the Sixth Street I get the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the mood  Django Unchained you have Django and jango&#39;s like it kind of has a two dimensional character but I don&#39;t think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is and you have dr. King Schultz who&#39;s this who&#39;s this like his mentor character and the person I was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and so and because he was intelligent there&#39;s no way he would have risked his life to save Django or like would have gone into this like second act where they go and they go to the plantation to deceive Django&#39;s wife excetera and and the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn&#39;t but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not  sacrificed himself for someone else which straight which strikes me as so like  like who like she&#39;s her bit her basic argument was that like altruism doesn&#39;t it cuz it was too. I even ran type of argument altruism doesn&#39;t exist the only the only thing you can do is sit like the only thing people do is serve them self so it&#39;s not quite Iron Man but it&#39;s like the only thing that people like old people are out to serve himself which I&#39;m not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism in and something like even the most altruistic type decision there&#39;s maybe like kernels of self self interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor in an in like what but what how how horrible is your life if that&#39;s like what your ultimate  hurt like if you can&#39;t like love and sacrifice for other people so let it to an extremely passionate debate and somewhat like yeah it is said that  so so yeah that that I guess that&#39;s the I don&#39;t think I necessarily like lost my temper I think I&#39;m losing my temper is being more  like I just I would  revert to ad hominem like attacks but I didn&#39;t like that&#39;s not maybe I was like maybe I was criticizing her worldview but I wasn&#39;t like well you&#39;re an idiot you know like it wasn&#39;t it didn&#39;t it didn&#39;t turn into abuse of any sort yeah I&#39;m glad you understand  an event or I don&#39;t know if I necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory I would say an issue that I have is not being able to remember in as much detail as I would like to remember feelings and moments not stories like my life doesn&#39;t always think together until like a coherent story it&#39;s like this moment in that moment in this moment in that moment yeah  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to make  the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make  ouchies  could it just be one of the hardest decisions  choosing between two things that it&#39;s like  I guess I&#39;m having a hard time recalling a moment where I like had to choose between  two options like no there&#39;s no like Sophie&#39;s Choice type moment in my life  but I but I do think that the decision cuz I lived in New York for a while I went to school in New York and the decision to leave New York after having lived there for five years was it was very very difficult  and but I had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all my core group of friends were either likely were Muslim we&#39;re leaving and going other places in the world and then the one other person or as close to it was living with someone who I did not get along with it all so it&#39;s like the situation where I didn&#39;t lose either going to live with people who I wasn&#39;t his clothes with or Craigslist or or move home and I think it was a tough decision to to leave that the only way I could do it I had to justify it by saying that I would be moving back to New York with in like a month or two which wasn&#39;t which didn&#39;t end up happening but that was the only way that I could leave New York  you was how hard was that or how hard is how hard was that  it was it was just a very like isolating ice is also like I&#39;d felt like previously to that time I&#39;d fallen in love with one of my closest another one of my close very close friends and  that had kind of gone extremely  badly and so I wasn&#39;t on speaking terms with her and I couldn&#39;t like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like closer to her her it was quite like her me type thing but that that was the way that I kind of  saw it at the time so I didn&#39;t like you know just being socially isolated  yeah  how easy is it for you to get a good night&#39;s sleep was recently it&#39;s been awful  I like to eat so the last last night I slept for like 10 and a half hours which seems to be the length of time that I have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night  so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that I got four hours in 2 hours of sleep cuz I was working on sat and I would get back and either and I just like couldn&#39;t fall asleep for whatever reason it&#39;s  too much Roundup energy or something I don&#39;t know  tired very  not immediately I just initially upon waking up like I really enjoy being up in the early morning  and I also stopped drinking caffeine like I&#39;ve had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days I hadn&#39;t had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so  I guess with with caffeine in my system I&#39;m ready to I&#39;m ready to go without caffeine it&#39;s I&#39;m just I&#39;m just quieter I guess  more introverted  since Lake lately is in Latin  changing my thoughts yeah I mean I guess when having just moved here and there is a. Of time like at the beginning where the  the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people. They moved here cuz I have a group of friends here or couple of friends I don&#39;t have like a large number friends and the the push 2  to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure is pretty overwhelming at first and I think that I&#39;m slowly like  coming to terms with that  and moving in a moving past it at but not like it&#39;s still it&#39;s still there the pressures there but I&#39;m just you know  you know you know you know  no I just  nope  the last time I felt really happy  might have to reach back  I think the last time I felt really happy  was during the writing process of salt last year I shot a movie co-wrote co-directed co-produced  and that was kind of like that it still consumes my life but I think that during the  writing stages of that movie in which we would like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative  energy between me and the person riding it in  and there is like probably like a good day that I remember where it&#39;s just I remember going to bed and I was just so thrilled to be working on when I was working on and and and working with the person I was working with and like  just like  I felt like it yeah I guess that was the the last time that was that was like more than a year ago though but I guess it&#39;s hard it&#39;s hard to think that I haven&#39;t been really truly happy since then but when you&#39;re making a movie like you don&#39;t you can&#39;t allow yourself to be happy especially if you&#39;re doing it basically by yourself with with like kind of like you can&#39;t too much else to do  I would say that I&#39;m very  except like accepting of other people and always very empathic  and  open like  excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and  yeah  I guess I wish I was last  less ruled by fear more more Fearless in my you know  everyday in our actions and in my like  you know  zest for for living  yeah I  I got other things I would change about myself I would I would  I don&#39;t know  really badly about myself  I Need A Renewed numerous instances in my childhood in which my like like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of  some sort of  conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always  always on the other side of the Court you know like never it was I noticed  or noticed as I got older that other people other parents were like at their kid was in trouble like there&#39;s something wrong with with like their kid was perfect there something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite in particular my mom sorry it said that there are a couple of instances in which  I was like blamed her like you know  it was my was my fault when  when what I was doing it like  Yeah Yeahs think things things that I couldn&#39;t like  no yeah I don&#39;t know  yeah  10 years ago  stay steak unit like I I think that there is  I have a tendency to  like I&#39;d love to love the fact that I have a tendency to get really caught up in ID in an idea in like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes  ideas are too easily decided to say like do as much as possible like don&#39;t don&#39;t decide that you  are only going to do one thing try to like I guess I would have taken up like some taking piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums would have been drums more than reading music I would say I&#39;d love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes  as far as like cuz I was always really into directing so he&#39;s directing actors and stuff but I didn&#39;t it&#39;s only now that I I don&#39;t know I guess  stay  Don&#39;t Stay Stay Stay yeah I don&#39;t know that&#39;s a tough tough tough question la  that&#39;s it  sure  goodbye  but  all right  experience with Ellie
418 can she see me  okay  okay okay  and please  are you okay with this  I&#39;m okay  I was born in Mississippi  when I was 2 and 1/2 years old but actually wasn&#39;t me all day was kind of Monica  yes  never  I was only two and a half years old I don&#39;t remember everything  things you really like about Olay  oh I like the beach I love all the restaurants the music thing just a general excitement in the Parks and all that  the traffic do maintenance on the streets all the potholes  the pollution  well I study a number of things at school I studied  at one point I was I I had major in public relations journalism specialization journalism then I also studied as a pre-law major and so I studied the law and then I also studied human and Human Services courses  mainly because I&#39;m a people person and I enjoy helping people  that&#39;s great  what&#39;s your dream job  wow dream job  my dream job  I don&#39;t really have one right now  okay  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer  do you travel a lot  no I don&#39;t and I can&#39;t even see your shoes  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver  what do you do  listen to music watch horror movies I love horror flicks and I have a fish tank tooth I like to watch my fish also like to play tennis when I can I haven&#39;t been able to play Lately though because of physical problems  can you tell me about that  it&#39;s just that I had injury drum mic my my ankle because I have anemia and and I got dizzy one night and I fell on my ankle and on my leg and so I&#39;m just waiting for that to really heal but I&#39;m planning on getting back into town this is one of the things I enjoy doing it really relaxes me  I really don&#39;t have a temper over the years I&#39;ve learned how to do how to control that  probably would have been yesterday but there was no argument and what was it about  nothing that I can recall  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  something I feel guilty about  there&#39;s nothing right now that I feel guilty about  a situation that I wish I had handled differently  I really can&#39;t think of one right now  the hardest decision  be absolutely hardest decision that I ever had to make was when my I have twins twin twin boys are grown now I had twins twin teen teenagers and I had lost my job and we were living in a motel and the rent for the motel was outrageous I couldn&#39;t no longer continue to pay the cable the type of money that they wanted so I had to briefly put my son under the and in foster care for 4 for a minute that was the hardest decision I had to make  schizophrenic and he had had he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training for a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hair when he was 4 years old but  and then we turned 14 to schizophrenia came up so right now he he&#39;s going to supportive living environment is 27 years old he&#39;s come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now that I had problems in the past because he didn&#39;t want to take the medication to give him the medication and he hide it and stick it in his pocket or whatever so but he&#39;s come to terms with that and we will all have come to terms with that he&#39;s doing he&#39;s doing pretty good  that son he&#39;s 27 to Texas with his wife and he got a promotion to  so now he&#39;s in California to buffering California okay so that&#39;s a very good about that yeah  well I&#39;ve grown children are grown children  not it&#39;s not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger it was difficult times okay difficult. And is this a good time to but yeah there&#39;s some difficult times  well the difficult times I really pretty much already alluded to Matt was when one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenia can and they were in temporarily and when was in foster care and one was actually in an institution because of the schizophrenia so  and I lost track of the question  the hardest thing about being a parent at this point this point in my life there is nothing hard about it  what&#39;s the best thing about being a parent  the best thing about being a parent I don&#39;t know I guess it&#39;s just to see something that you created and developed into a pretty decent human being you know a person  smsa  oh a lot of ways well actually I didn&#39;t have two parents I had a mother and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so I have no contact with him but the things that I do  differently than what my mother did she was a strong disciplinarian both verbally and physically  and she had the tendency to see how group has tendency to be very critical critical and  opinionated and very religious  and swearing  for a look at people who were not that was me as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church and reading the Bible and all that kind of thing  was that the park  the question  I don&#39;t get a good night sleep I don&#39;t sleep at all unless I take medication and that&#39;s that that&#39;s all there is to it I don&#39;t take medication I don&#39;t sleep I&#39;ll be up all night I will be up for days if I don&#39;t take medication  irritable  I&#39;m tired  well  lately  you know just a little anxious really you know I just recently made a move to a new apartment has a lot of expenses and new experiences and things like that and I will new furniture and leave this and that that you have to get a managed to do all that but the whole thing was kind of stressful  POF  no not PTSD  we are  that was back in I think 2004  because my life has gotten so stressful to the point where it was either I had to do something or or in something to tell you the truth  yes  yeah I think it&#39;s useful you know what&#39;s a good sounding board you know someone to throw you know your concerns out and we&#39;ll discuss things that may be bothering you are good things to eat with medication  cuz I&#39;ve been going to therapy the changes a lot of changes I&#39;ve been more focused  more  hopeful  it is just been a good experience for me which is why I&#39;ve been saying to go  really happy  well I can feel really happy by some currents I can&#39;t think of anything right now just like that and then I go back to how I was feeling so I can&#39;t really pinpoint anything really I mean  I mean something comes to me unexpectedly or things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time  that makes me happy when things go right how about that  something I did recently  but I really  can I live with somebody that I really enjoyed being really really enjoyed  recently  I can&#39;t think of anything  I don&#39;t have a best friend  my best qualities or that  I&#39;m an honest person  I genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt everyone in my book  is as they appear to be until they prove prove it differently very generous overly generous  and I&#39;m very I like to help other people I mean help them come on a personal level and help people problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody that&#39;s helping their mouth  anything I regret  how so  it&#39;s only one thing I regret and that is sad  after my twins that became old enough to start going to school at the elementary school level  I was taking some courses as a pre-law major and  at the time I was married to their father turned out not to be a good  fit for me and  because of the stresses involved with him  well knowing that that was running and I was going to leave him I dropped out of college  that was my biggest regret  stay in school no matter what stay the course no matter what  but I&#39;m a good person  I&#39;m a good human being  fo  okay  goodbye  that&#39;s going to go go by are you done  okay  I was weird  I was a little weird I was a little nervous

Oakley but most the time I really don&#39;t have much contact with family  probably parents both have been very supportive  probably when the parents were sick passed away  is it uncomfortable  no  well I like the both parents were  I got sick and got dementia and you know one parent didn&#39;t remember who I was so as that part was pretty difficult  wow  well they they passed away so it&#39;s just been about 10 years so it&#39;s just just memories now  not too easy  just tossing and turning all night I think and probably thinking thinking too much about things  probably like the future things like the economy and my work things like that  tired  how did the feeling lately tired  just not as positive  no  no  probably  few weeks ago I received a pretty good Real Estate Commission so I was happy about that  suspend your ideal weekend  I want time in LA  going to some of the meetup groups or some some of the I like going to Whole Foods and then trying some new places to go salsa dancing  okay  is there anything you regret  probably to be more outgoing  probably be more successful in business and be a little more  outgoing  tell me about a time when someone  probably my boss said he&#39;s pretty condescending  and I&#39;m really likes to belittle people and put him put himself as the king so he leave had a lot of comments to make himself build himself up and the little whoever whoever else is in the room  usually when you go in he likes to brag on how much money he&#39;s made in the business and then say things like go see was how much better I am than you are you  look how much money I&#39;ve made this year in and you&#39;re the worst piece of shit agent there is  things like that  probably have integrity and good heart hard-working  honest  probably  I just went I guess some of the times I&#39;ve gone dancing I went to a casino in a little town called Temecula I met a lot of new friends and  did the dancing meeting Friends new friends  probably  I&#39;ll let the education I guess my education and able to move move out here where I wanted to go  thank you  bye  computer when you&#39;re finished
456 okay  occasion  yes  and well thank you  Boston Massachusetts  I moved to LA about a year after graduating college in 2001  quite often least a couple times a year  God I love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there&#39;s things about both of them that I love  I have to pursue acting and writing  it&#39;s still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what I wanted to creatively and there&#39;s different the social culture was different in a way we&#39;re at from where I had grown up and it it suited me better my personality  I like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of in creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path I grew up where its nose constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly I like that it&#39;s you can swim year-round and I like that it&#39;s there&#39;s always something to do no matter what day of the week it is  I don&#39;t like well I miss my Sam I miss that there&#39;s no I don&#39;t like that there&#39;s not a big family element here I miss I&#39;m a big family girl I miss my family I feel like it&#39;s very crowded here but yet it&#39;s very easy to feel sort of isolated alone here  I&#39;m sure you can  I can&#39;t see you she is but I do mostly just not up to much worldly travel mostly back to Boston and Florida where my parents live but I do enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within California and around here  I just have an adventure do something fun or if I&#39;m going home it means I want to see my family  oh my god well I like to drive up to Northern California go to San Francisco and family and friends they&#39;re always super super fun. In college I with my college boyfriend from Boston to eat we drove we went to San Francisco and drove down to LA and Las Vegas and that was kind of how I realize I wanted to move here so that was very that was ready I was a big one  in general  I guess it would be moving here I move to when I move to LA I got on a plane with didn&#39;t know anybody here and I just got I talk to a girl and I met online and agreed to be her roommate and she pick me up at the airport we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely don&#39;t deflate out here was his big monumental  I felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever  telecommunications got a lots of every lot of different writing writing styles eventually graduated with a concentration in public relations and English minor  what made you decide to do  writing cursive writing  writer of I guess you could say writer-actress which is but I guess writing is first  hard very hard because you need to know he&#39;s going to push you to do what you have to be self starter you have to make it happen so it&#39;s very hard cuz I don&#39;t think that&#39;s that naturally in my personality I do but not as much as I need to  I would say are going on in general  pink screensaver  I sometimes take a walk if I feel tense listen ambient music helps if I need a soothing background white noise calming, area and just it&#39;s your basic depressed and just sort of take a minute to come back to it, Mitchell place  I am getting better at controlling my temper cuz I don&#39;t usually have a temper too often but when I do and I lose my cool I have a hard time controlling it  yes  no  argue with someone God  I guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend if it wasn&#39;t it was about our  are each separate perspectives on a a certain situation between us but obviously very very different and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is this is stupid we don&#39;t need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly  I guess it would have been with an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn&#39;t need to be I wish that I had just walked away from it  I don&#39;t know if I could have avoided the complete situation but I definitely could have  May the outcome much less  chaotic  I guess that would be  walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life, but I really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and  kind of sort of growing out my coming to a point where I have to say I&#39;m going to do something that&#39;s really really hard for sort of Me no short-term pain for long-term gain and I had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carry over into other areas of my life and taught me that you know you&#39;re not always going to feel great every decision is not going to be easy and feel good  are you happy  yes  I was kind of forced to this issue was just what was going on in life was sort of can ignore those signs just yeah  I guess it would be a particular argument I had with somebody that happened to be in sorry about public place and got in trouble for it I wish I could erase  mileage to my family have a wonderful family completely blessed amazing parents have a brother and as he has a little girls have a baby niece that I love more than anything in the world and I could not ask for a better family therapy the idea  my parents for sure there&#39;s wonderful people and then stop by example and I feel like I&#39;m a good mix of both of them  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  pretty easy I try lately it&#39;s been a little bit hard my sleeps been off but for the most part I&#39;ve come to recognize the importance of it and it&#39;s it&#39;s been pretty easy  Lig fidgety maybe a little bit out of it I might might seem like I&#39;m in a good mood cuz I might be a little Gideon laughing more just sort of high emotions but overall get irritated faster and just sweat more just feel feel just a little off  not really just try to be more focused get things done  I&#39;m just trying to focus on what I want to do career-wise and really  stop wasting time or if you know just procrastinating and get things done and being inspired going and seeing you and being around people that are doing what I want to do and just carrying it over to my own life  no  no  oh just a couple days I was just in with my family and my baby niece in Florida and that&#39;s why I went down there to see her so it was just awesome I&#39;m always happy when I see her  probably as very  funny humor would definitely probably one of the first things they would say joking always a little wiseass and my personality but they would describe me as always at unconditional there for them and just  they know they know that I&#39;m there if they need them always  my drive be more driven and getting things done  I guess it would be bought a recent a recent ex boyfriend that was a mistake of a relationship  yeah sort of just  the they think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn&#39;t directly make me feel about the whole situation made me realize the fact that I&#39;m even with this person made me feel like I&#39;m allowing people into my life that shouldn&#39;t be there so I&#39;m dumbing myself down and that was terrible  yes I regret not listening to my gut instincts  don&#39;t second-guess yourself  great listener  constant sense of humor very malleable in terms of people tolerant and comfortable around all  people from just all ages race gender whatever I just I crave diversity and love to just meet him I just I&#39;m a people person and I start everyday with a blank slate  I did some acting work on a on a series with a really great group of people and it was it was a very cool cool creative experience by inspiring  probably coming out to LA on my own without knowing anybody and staying here and pursuing what I want to do  thank you  bye
716 not very typical to that happen but just in case I kind of have to give you a warning so that you don&#39;t sit in here can I go in what&#39;s going on so it fits yeah I&#39;d say 30 seconds or more  for real  I&#39;m going to go ahead and start her up okay  I&#39;m not a therapist  and please  okay  how are you doing today all right  Inland Empire  just got here I&#39;m not too sure good buildings  there&#39;s a lot of people are obnoxious  getting around kind of a headache but it&#39;s alright buses are pretty good  you travel a lot yes  pain away  different sceneries  different places different people  well  going to North Carolina  man to do with military  but none recently  I don&#39;t think I have one not anymore  I guess going overseas  studying solar panel technology in currently studying right now  student  on my own business and what I don&#39;t know yet  but something looking for myself  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  both  it&#39;s not good right now I don&#39;t really talk to him  certain situations came up I don&#39;t really talk to him  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10  I know it&#39;s not Hawaii  gym I go to the gym let us tension  stress anything that I can possibly do one thing I know going to the gym  the only thing I really got right now that relieves anything that I have  not sure  I can control it at times  sometimes it&#39;ll get out of control  my girlfriend we are getting pretty good. It was about why I don&#39;t call her enough and when I wasn&#39;t calling her enough  you got pretty bad  there&#39;s a lot of them  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  guilty  there&#39;s nothing to feel guilty about  a lot of them I don&#39;t even talk about but being close to my family is one of the things that I never did and I and I and I regret that  tell me about the hardest decision ever had  I said there was a lot of decision hard decision that I made but I never made them  I can say what you can say I took the easy way out maybe  tell me about Nevada  don&#39;t know  have you ever  yes  alright then again not good  it&#39;s hard to explain  don&#39;t know how to even start it  UPS down depression  dealing with going back to school money  I hit you can say I hit rock bottom and I&#39;m starting my life over again  yeah that&#39;s because of no longer doing things that I ain&#39;t supposed to do  but it&#39;s hard  can you tell me about that  well from a previous addict  why do I get to that I don&#39;t know  I&#39;m not even to share all I know is that I was just doing the wrong things at the wrong time got me to so much trouble  now I&#39;m starting over cuz I lost everything  but I&#39;m happy about how I&#39;m starting now  it&#39;s slow but kind of like an adventure at the same time there&#39;s a lot of things that I&#39;m thinking about as well a lot of things that I can&#39;t forget  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I can&#39;t I&#39;m under sleep meds  two types and sometimes I can&#39;t even fall asleep it&#39;ll take I can&#39;t take more than I  I&#39;m prescribed  but I have problems sleeping  why  I really don&#39;t know why  bad dreams  past events  thoughts to keep on popping up  bad mood depression  I&#39;m not too sure  irritable on edge  you can say sometimes I&#39;ll be walking around back if I&#39;m tense from worried about something  more less worried about falling asleep when I&#39;m sleeping  I believe so yes just currently not too long ago  currently filing my claim  yes that&#39;s one thing I didn&#39;t been diagnosed with for sure  I don&#39;t like it I hate it I don&#39;t know if I can pull out of it  I don&#39;t even think the medication that I&#39;m even using even helps  I&#39;m still trying to get try different ones apparently there&#39;s enough out there that I can go through  maybe more than a year ago  about a year ago for my depression  isolation not really talking with anybody  I wouldn&#39;t really be so like a people person communication wasn&#39;t all time low  I will be mainly staying at the house I wouldn&#39;t be going out I wouldn&#39;t be doing events or doing the things that I would like to do  none of us was alone with my addiction as well  that&#39;s one thing I can&#39;t figure out is what the hell trigger though  why am I like this  why am I actually doing things or did the things that I do or did  coming in Natick  not communicating with my family  I wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t like this before  how do you cope with them  I don&#39;t know  the only thing I got on my side of the gym it&#39;s the one place that I know I can release a lot of tension  that one place where I know I don&#39;t have to talk to people but we&#39;re all together they&#39;re doing the same thing we&#39;re all doing the same thing and exercising and getting physically well  the only place where I know that I can relax  certain events that took place  I lost certain loved ones  I lost certain relation lost a relationship  I don&#39;t talk to my family and I think I said that already  got in trouble with the law yeah it is  you still go to therapy  yes I go to a couple of them  you feel therapy in Hughesville  sometimes sometimes not depending what the the topic is  or we&#39;re probably talking about the same thing over again  the changes that I&#39;ve noticed maybe a little bit less stress knowing that I have a couple more skills or tools to cope with my depression PTSD  not knowing when I&#39;m going to have an outburst  controlling myself here in there  but it&#39;s it&#39;s a long process also on my recovery is going to be a forever process  when I made up with my girlfriend that was what two days ago  we are you and I talked about it with her and she was able to hear me out and I was able to hear her out and we fix things so that was the happiest moment so far  that&#39;s great  my case managers  done to my my group sessions  and my girlfriend even though it&#39;s much of a bitch she is she still good person  he asks why I have one best friend right now  and it&#39;s funny that you have because now that I remember he referred me as a saint which I don&#39;t think I do that I don&#39;t think I am that but I&#39;m sure everybody&#39;s trying to say is that I&#39;m a good person and I&#39;m trying to do right and I don&#39;t want to inflict harm on nobody and I just want to get myself put back together and continue

sometimes it&#39;s really very difficult for me to sleep even if I&#39;ve had a long day and didn&#39;t sleep the night before sometimes I still have trouble falling asleep or I don&#39;t sleep throughout the night  Restless irritable  I feel hungry all the time even though I&#39;ve just eaten  about it  no  have you been diagnosed  yes  when I before I got out of the army so it&#39;s back in 1992  restlessness  hard to concentrate sleeping late  elevated alcohol use of alcohol  overconsumption  not that I&#39;m aware of  tell me more about that  I don&#39;t know just makes me feel bad sometimes depression feel down don&#39;t feel like getting out doing anything just rather climb into bed and pull the covers over my head  how do you cope with them  I just the realization that it&#39;s just one of my moods and eventually it&#39;s going to sometimes I&#39;m down I feel down and I just deal with it  I learned over course of time that it just comes and goes and I just wish for it to go away  the feelings that I was going to hurt somebody or hurt someone else  do you still go to therapy now  I&#39;m going to start therapy again but I haven&#39;t been going for about a year or two years  Deerfield Fair  yes I do  no no not today  I haven&#39;t started going to therapy yet  all right  when is the last time  when I was on the cruise so that will be between July 14th and 21st and when I was driving the speedboat down in Cozumel  I could you repeat that  can you tell me about that  I didn&#39;t understand that  my best friend probably would describe me as being driven dependable  motivated smart funny intelligent  my trip to my cruise with my family  nice  what are you most proud of in your  working on my Master&#39;s Degree my service in the military  that&#39;s about it  thank you  goodbye  yeah I can tell it&#39;s a little work-in-progress there yeah  just bear with me for a second on sling TV
329 equipment  virtual human chat with you for a bit and when she&#39;s done  okay  are you okay  yes  pretty well  from New York  to go to college or go to San Diego to go to college and then later to LA  aerospace engineering  it was I was really good at math and science and I had an interest in airplanes  no  I&#39;m a life coach  how to be a life coach and help people  have I really really like how it feels to help other people and see them grow and know that I made a contribution to their life  I like the weather is great cuz I really like to do outdoor things and I like doing things by the ocean  traffic and how crowded it is  yeah  I like I live with my girlfriend and I liked it  we met on eHarmony  I really close  hi my meditation teacher  yeah I used to be very shy and self-conscious and have a lot of anxiety and worry a lot about the future and 2 classes meditation and yoga classes and really helped me to be more confident more relaxed and just enjoy life a lot more  meditate and do yoga  seriously mad  I don&#39;t know about bad I don&#39;t get mad that often but frustrated I would say like being stuck in traffic or people that do mean things to other people for no real reason  I usually if it&#39;s usually talk to somebody about it if I can or if I can&#39;t then I usually do meditation or yoga and try and just let it go  a pretty good that controlling my temper  with my girlfriends and it was about she was driving on the freeway and I suggested that she get over cuz there were some Road workers on the side and she like refused to do that stayed in the the right lane so we argued a little bit about that  I felt like she wasn&#39;t listening to me and almost like she was purposely not doing what I suggested to be defiant  no  rollerblade kayak sing I sing in the choir  I trip I took to India and Nepal for 6 weeks  yeah as much as I can  I really love to explore and I&#39;d love to explore ever since I was a little kid and so I love you and seeing new things and discovering things about new cultures and I love backpacking in the wilderness and see no exploring nature  well I went on a trip to India and Nepal it&#39;s my first time ever there the first week and a half of his with a big group of people and did a meditation and Yoga Retreat and went white water rafting on the ganga River and then I went off on my own for the rest of the trip and went backpacking in Nepal with a guide there and I was just really beautiful in the Annapurna area and then I went to back into India and explored the area up near to bed and then I went to Rajasthan into a tiger Park in my diaper desk and it&#39;s like really close to tigers  I was contacted by a friend of mine and told that they were going on this this trip and I&#39;d always wanted to go to India so I decided to do it  yeah I was there was really fun  caring and enthusiastic for life  now  no  no  I&#39;m pretty easy I don&#39;t sleep as well as I did when I was younger but for the most part I sleep well once in a while I&#39;ll wake up you know at like 4 in the morning or 5 in the morning when I want to sleep till 7 and not be able to get back to sleep but in general is pretty good  I feel tired and not as motivated as usual and then sometimes want to take a nap in the afternoon  no  10 or 20 years ago  I guess to wish I would have been vested money or bought like a house or something when I was younger  I would probably get it right so I get myself  I am sympathetic with other people positive and can I have a positive outlook on life very determined when I decide to do something I&#39;ll figure out how to do it even if it&#39;s challenging very creative and figure it out creative ways to do things I guess probably the strongest thing is that I&#39;m pretty balanced very organized but I&#39;m also pretty creative so pretty balanced that way  I&#39;m pretty close but closer than I was when I was younger although I said probably closer to friends and people that are in a spiritual Community with me then I&#39;m able to get to my family  being outdoors and nature and exercising and also singing  the fact that I&#39;ve gone with followed my heart and then what I wanted to do versus going with what I think I should do  I guess yesterday I was. I spent the day by the beach and just bicycle then went skating and visited some old friends there  I felt very relaxed and invigorated and also felt like I missed living by the beach cuz I used to live really close to the beach  so I guess I let little bit sad that I didn&#39;t live there anymore but really happy to be there  goodbye
437 okay  oh okay  yes  I&#39;m doing pretty good  I was born in Los Angeles  I like the diversity of the city all the attractions and things that you can see food restaurant  it&#39;s like that  traffic freeways crime  yes I do  seeing new places or going back and seeing same places and just enjoying the Lacs and getting away from LA  Wellwood said last trip by made with up to the central coast up in Cambria and Pismo Beach area and Solvang standing  yeah  probably a when I got to study abroad in Madrid Spain when I was a student at UCLA  sometimes a child yeah I was I participated in the education abroad program at UCLA where you go live in another country to learn language when you live before year after University study at the University and that it was just a memorable year and experience that I would never forget  thanks  probably more shy but the that sometimes I could be outgoing  I&#39;m more shy in terms of being alive. It takes me it takes time for me to get to know people I mean I&#39;m not a real party person I don&#39;t like to go to parties and meet people and things like that but if I&#39;m among friends and think like that but I can be for the outgoing  with people I know  the drink wine  yeah I drink wine maybe listen to some nice music  pretty good I can I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my emotions  oh gosh I wouldn&#39;t say it was a real argument it was more like a discussion maybe about  finances Maybe  money  I was just a little irritated but the not really not really strong emotional  oh  wow guys I can&#39;t think of anything at the moment so I&#39;ll look for the skip that one  maybe  eating eating more junk food than I admit to  or  the hardest decision I ever have to make  Maybe  buying a home buying a home or remodeling the home  spending money for  it was a I felt it was time to move on with my life and to buy a place for myself so I could be self-sufficient and independent  yes very happy  and then I could erase from my mouth when I when I was when I was student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential undiscovered I never enjoyed it I want a race that whole year 1983  it just brought back horrible horrible memories of what I went through when I was student teaching in the discovered that teaching K-12 with no not for me  I stood my major was Spanish and linguistics  what made you decide  I was very good on languages and I thought them I enjoyed taking them and I was just having a good time taking foreign language and I was getting good grades so I thought maybe this is what I should go into foreign languages  I was teaching I was in the Delta teacher teaching English as a second language for 30 years and I just recently decided to retire myself  I have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters and my father passed away in 2008 and my relationship with my father wasn&#39;t as good as with my other family members  fucked up on the phone the whole time we have pretty good relation with the with my family now  pretty easy I don&#39;t have any problems  if I don&#39;t sleep well I&#39;m I may be moving around in the bed and messing up the sheets but that doesn&#39;t happen too often  pretty good I think I&#39;ve been feeling pretty good no major health problems or anyting  no  no  no  last time I was really happy  I probably when spring break came around and with a vacation time and it was time to go on our trip  yeah it was a it was a week trip up to Central Coast to Cambria and Pismo Beach and Santa Ynez was just the nice getaway relaxing on the hotel lawn and garden drinking wine and enjoying different sites and eating good food and then buying were going to replenish our dwindling Supply at home  I think she would describe me as a kind and sweet and motivated and nice person  oh sometimes I wouldn&#39;t mind being a little more outgoing I guess I tend to be more reserved so I wouldn&#39;t mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things with  really badly about myself probably when I betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when I take them when I tape them singing Christmas carols and I I played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that  but it all got resolved at the end we all we became we were all hot it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part but it worked out okay  probably having done what I did bikes playing at the other people  what advice would I give myself 10 or 20 years ago and don&#39;t give up just keep keep pursuing what you want never never give up with CU does a hint of a disappointment if nothing if it doesn&#39;t work out  I&#39;m a I&#39;m a good listener I&#39;m I&#39;m a motivated person I&#39;m hardworking I&#39;m conscientious I&#39;m caring assembly a pretty happy type person  something recently when I really enjoyed  going to the going to the Festival of books at USC this weekend  yeah that Festival of books is it&#39;s a festival where they have all these off authors and they have them food demonstrations seminars and all kinds of books available to look at and there is a lot of food and then a lot of authors signing books and things it&#39;s a great event for her to get out and end with nice weather to so it&#39;s nice to be out there I really enjoyed that  thanks  I&#39;m most proud of  most proud of probably being successful in my work and my life and my marriage and  I just basically being happy with myself  well you&#39;re welcome  bye  but it  oh okay I wasn&#39;t sure if I was supposed to bring it over haha
633 and she&#39;s a speech recognition so like recognize what you say and then uses a series of complex equations to know stay back and it&#39;s entirely automated by the controller  and the reason we have the webcam and the connect is so that the system can also recognize your facial expressions and your posture  bring up for a second and then check it back down and then  thanks  like this  reminds me of like some kind of like I&#39;m on state or something like I said yeah  only if I had some of the voices of some of these singers  actually you know what I was thinking I should have probably wore red pants instead of blue but I might get some more blue than red  yeah thanks I&#39;ve been here for like 10 years yeah and I asked I saw it a virgin Megastore in Hollywood years ago it was the last one and at the time I had a jacket that I got to customize for these so I get away jacket and I&#39;m like what I need to do something with the shoes or just kind of sitting there so  but thank you  brachio  7 * 3  okay  so she&#39;s confusing questions and when she&#39;s  okay  she looks so real that&#39;s cool  but it&#39;s  okay  gotcha  thank you  yes  I&#39;m doing pretty good happy content  not stressed out so good  a Los Angeles California born and raised  well besides me and my home I love that there is so many various things to do I don&#39;t believe you can live here and be bored if you are active person like myself  that is so overcrowded it&#39;s just too many people here people are not more hospitable I mean if you speak to someone I feel like I should speak back and I look at you like they want to do something to you or just wake up so angry I don&#39;t like a lot of our political laws or issues that we have here and the economy  you travel  not as much as I would like to but yes I do  I enjoy the whole set up the whole agenda the planning the research and I find that very exciting for me I like exploring new places I never been a going back somewhere I really love that just the thought of how much I&#39;m going to put a sign for shopping also don&#39;t return Wars and picture taking doing videos and is creating a new experience that I had never had before  sure I recently just came back from San Francisco I&#39;ve been there before but I was in one particular part of the Castro district and I explored other parts of San Francisco is one of my favorite places to go in the first place I decide to go besides putting down my luggage at a hotel would be a restaurant called Scoma&#39;s which is actually on the pier and they have the best crab cakes ever and the last time I went I saw Jerry Springer the show you no talk show host I did some shopping I actually met up with friends or some bars actually went I&#39;m a foodie so I went to a couple of restaurants or heard about on the Food Network I took a boat ride and I&#39;ve visited some friends so I really had a good time  I have several of those but one of my most memorable experiences in life would be  the day that  Barack Obama became president that was a memorable experience for me and I wish that a lot of my family members who have passed on was here to see that  that would always stay with me like a tattoo is a very memorable moment that they&#39;ll never be forgetting it&#39;ll go down in history and it is history and it&#39;s just a great experience for me and other people like myself to know that we have transition Beyond race and that will in some ways and that you know anyone can become president and really fulfill their dreams  there&#39;s no limits  World depends on  okay I am a dispatch manager the last school I attended with  and I have my degree in homeland security and investigations I work for a private security firm I&#39;m actually over seeing about 12 to 20 people a day I worked various hours and my job is very tedious I do a lot of problem solving and it makes the night go by fast I work from 10:30 to 6:30 and within the Dispatch Center I should say a command center that I oversee we do dispatch and also surveillance so half of the night we&#39;re looking at 20 cameras for corporate and residential account also dealing with supervisors and security officers who actually are at a site and we put them in with Carter mobile vehicle or mobile van where they stay on site until the actual site is ready and develop for people to come through after construction so we make sure that we obtain and make sure these places are very  well-rounded with security we do a lot of observing and report so any information anything that&#39;s happening on site for the the security officers they allow us to know about it I do everything from inventory to attendants talking to other locations out-of-state making sure are a data information in their systems are updated a computer software so anything you think about I&#39;m actually involved in when it&#39;s far as the company is concerned so it&#39;s very tedious but very rewarding position  my dream job is completely opposite from what I have now I&#39;ve been writing some 36 I&#39;ve been writing songs since I was about nine years old and started when I was in the junior choir at church and I&#39;ve always had a passion for that I feel like that runs through my bloodstream music is is there&#39;s a song I would always say for every situation and occasion and I feel like music watch through my bloodstream is just a part of my DNA and who I am and my dream job would be an engineer who owns their own record label and a very big time songwriting / producer  oh I&#39;m definitely not shy that&#39;s not me at all I&#39;m very expressive person as you can probably hear I&#39;ve never been shy a day in my life but I&#39;m more outgoing more blunt I would say  that&#39;s just who I am I just feel like you know it&#39;s people we&#39;re all you know made up of different characteristics and personality traits and I just like expressing myself I talk a lot I get that from my father and I just you know what I what I feel I feel like I should put out there and voice my opinion like anyone else that&#39;s just who I am  interesting  that&#39;s a good question I listen to music but I like to go to the beach and taking the whole scenery just to smell the ocean you know water you know that that whole experience of my feet in the sand looking around just taking in the small things just you know I appreciate them Breeze I do stuff like that when I get a chance to but sometimes a glass of wine or just watching TV be having a conversation sometime praying that you know or whatever about anything that goes on with my family so it&#39;s different things I do and shopping always helps to his very therapeutic for me  that&#39;s number one I would say  pretty good I would say a my twenties I would have a different answer for you I was more quick-tempered I&#39;m pretty good with that yes I do get upset and angry about things depends on what it is but I just think what when you grow and you become you know you know you get older you know not always maturity doesn&#39;t always come with age and knowledge and I feel like as I&#39;ve grown as a person I&#39;m a lot older now more calm and more centered about things so I don&#39;t get is at angry as I used to it is a better way to deal with things besides getting angry  a couple of days ago and I argue with my ex girlfriend over the state of things in our past relationship that still bothers us both and we&#39;re just trying to get to the point where we can communicate better we say things when we&#39;re angry we&#39;re still heard about things we&#39;re trying to work through so that was the last argument I had  there&#39;s so many of those I wish I would have handled  a lot differently  wow so many of those situations I wish I would have handled differently  good question I&#39;m sorry for taking so long it&#39;s just so many things I I think about  wow  handled differently  I don&#39;t know that such a hard question but you know I can&#39;t answer that question for you  I can we plan example I was I think maybe 18 years old and are 19 and my brother is a couple years younger than me my dad is physically abusive and he was never there for us he was the type of father who just kind of came around my mom will let him whoop us or he&#39;ll show up whenever he wanted to but he wasn&#39;t obsessed and your father that was active in our lives and one particular time I guess my mom and told my dad that my brother was having company without permission and he went over there and you beat him up really bad the only reason I knew was because I was working for my mom at her hair salon and he brought them up they&#39;re black and blue and and bloody and I feel like I had a nervous breakdown I didn&#39;t handle that well I feel like I  I&#39;ll should have been there to protect them I hope I&#39;m not going to cry cuz it still bothers me I feel like I should have been there to protect him and I wasn&#39;t and it bothers me and I take on a lot that bothers my wasn&#39;t there when it happened and I called social services and told them what happened and I just wish I would have took him to the hospital and I broke down and I just wish I would have been there for him and that bothers me and I just feel like I should have dealt with a better just took him to the hospital instead of going in the bathroom and crying  and that bothers the hell out of me to this day  just what I said about my brother  I just wish I was there for him when it happened  and I wasn&#39;t and I blame myself for it but I  I feel guilty about not being there for my ex-girlfriend  Financial at the time I couldn&#39;t get to Vegas so I couldn&#39;t be there for her when she was in hospital and sometimes you couldn&#39;t be there for me but it just I take a lot on my shoulders and I blame myself for stuff I know that I can&#39;t control but I feel guilty about that  Barry  about that and so many other things my grandfather Frank passed away and he was a great grandfather and I used to ask my family members when he was I don&#39;t know where he was located where he moved to new phone numbers anything and over the years I was asked what happened to him they need information and didn&#39;t tell me and then I found out years later that he passed away he was asking about me and I feel bad but I didn&#39;t know how to find him where he was so those are some of the things I feel bad for  tell me about the hardest.  It&#39;s a lot  I give you one a plan example  no I&#39;m never served in the military at all but I can&#39;t give an example of something my mom she does hair like I said she has her own hair is what I want for Karen hair salon I remember going to the shop one day just kind of hang out with her and she introduced me to a client of hers and I remember  the lady said oh I didn&#39;t realize you had a daughter I knew you had a son and this is the first time I heard that and it really got to me it hurt and I feel like there&#39;s no excuse for that and I didn&#39;t want her to explain and that just really hurt me to my callcore I talked to my dad about it I called him and he said I would just ignore it how do you ignore somebody saying that you don&#39;t even know that you exist how to ignore that and a part of me sometimes wish I could just erase a lot of things she&#39;s done like that away cuz it&#39;s still tends to bother me  I have no military experience I thought about in the past I thought about it since I actually got my degree in homeland security and investigation I thought about becoming a police officer there so many things I thought about getting into but the weather like freezes on certain positions I&#39;ve applied for I just went a different direction to still have to do with the type of law enforcement like what I&#39;m doing now but never got into that  I have no military experience I never signed up for the military just thought about it  are you happy  I&#39;m kind of really never thought about it by happier I didn&#39;t enlist or not somewhat yeah  I&#39;m happy with the way things are I don&#39;t think the military will actually be for me it&#39;s some good things about it like paying for college tuition always having to fall back on GI bill experience of you know fighting for your country but do I think that was for me I&#39;m kind of past that at this point I think I&#39;m past the age limit where you can even sign up for it so no I don&#39;t have any regrets  no  I have no experience in that so I don&#39;t know  I don&#39;t know if people that have been in the military like my family members uncles and aunties and Dino that are still here or not here anymore  never been in the military so that&#39;s I can&#39;t answer that question  I don&#39;t know I just heard about it but people have been through after they come by the military but I have no idea  overstressed  happy at moments  feeling sometimes to feed it  and insecure hurt I spent a lot of time alone  is it by choice no but  good and bad  not great  yeah happy a lot of times when there&#39;s moments where I&#39;m really really sad  is well too so they don&#39;t really balance each other out at all  not at all I do so much tossing and turning 4 years I don&#39;t remember last time I got a good amount of sleep until recently when I bought this Brookstone pillow which is been helping but I&#39;m still tossing and turning and then why can&#39;t I play there I want to go to sleep and it just does not happen and I don&#39;t know why if it&#39;s my stress or what&#39;s going on but my sleep patterns are not great and I still get up and do I have to do like I paid 9 hours or so so that&#39;s just me  active like I am now completely Wide Awake some days I&#39;m fatigued and tired and a little sad but usually I&#39;m just up and just being me and active and overly bubbly and a busybody  normally usually  yes in the past over 10 years ago I was diagnosed with that  yes  couple of days ago  I felt really happy  well sometimes you know in life because nobody&#39;s perfect and there&#39;s things I get to get out of it get to me sometimes you put the weight of the world on my shoulders and we take care of everybody else sometimes you get lost in that transition and I just seen I&#39;m happy to have everyday I thank God for every day I live and I&#39;m at I&#39;m up and I&#39;m able to work and do things that I need to do for myself and I do you spell happy and rested and I caught up on shows and I relax and I ate and I just had a good day of a peace and Tranquility which is not  it&#39;s not a regular thing for me is kind of weird to have those kind of days cuz it&#39;s so much is going on  oh that&#39;s easy my grandmother  she&#39;s been passed away for about 20 years now 20-plus say she&#39;s been the backbone of who I am I&#39;m so much like her as far as hard work and determined strong-willed I mean just the glue to keep the family together she was the backbone of our family and she&#39;s one of the she&#39;s my hero she did everything she you know she was so selfless she put everything on the back burner but everybody first you get what I mean because that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing to I know I get that from her just you know endless caring and loving I never had to question that and my grandmother even she was a rare commodity a real real person of so much goodness and I just appreciate everything she taught me he would pay for our public school I&#39;m sorry for a private school and help my mom and my dad when they first got married years and years ago with a second car will pick us up everyday everything she could to help and was there for everybody and then some she is a great example of a  but you know I&#39;m a human being that went beyond the Call of Duty to do everything she could for her family and she&#39;s my hero and I&#39;m really proud and honored to be a part of her bloodline and I miss her dearly  how is your best friend  I don&#39;t have one  but if they if I did have one I would say that would say that I&#39;m a loving person I love hard that I&#39;m creative and funny articulate down to earth very blunt a good friend and I value friendship you know and I made a mistake sometimes you piss me off I can be a little mean and be sarcastic but overall a good person that&#39;s just too hard on yourself  and doesn&#39;t get herself enough credit  and gets taken advantage of sometimes because of how nice I am  if I had one I was thinking it would say that  oh that&#39;s an easy one shopping I went to the mall and I shopped I shopped online I had so many packages coming from high heels tennis shoes to jackets and cute very creative sexy dresses so shopping puts my mind out of everything that we talked about as far as my feelings of hurt her insecurities all that goes away cuz shopping is therapeutic and once I get an idea in my mind and coordinating colors and I just know what I&#39;m doing this and that with I&#39;m very creative and in I like things out of the norm so that just makes me if I could shop all the time that would be a drink  nice thanks  my accomplishments with school me being out on my own for a long time I&#39;ve been on my own since I was 18 19 years old and I&#39;ve been able to keep up my own place and I&#39;m very responsible I pay my bills before I do anything else for me and I am very particular about paying bills and that&#39;s just always been at the Forefront to me to make sure to my house I was okay before I do anything else so I&#39;m proud of my maturity level and my responsibilities

Be fantastic brush your thumb at sooner than mail so I&#39;m not going to be able to do that  no not at all  I enjoy people being around people I&#39;m very talkative at times  I like to do a lot of things and I&#39;m very social I do them  I believe or not I play bridge I play chess and I watch a good old old movie  bad drivers  bad laws  politics often  I&#39;m annoyed  don&#39;t get annoyed that much I just let it go it&#39;s not worth the pain and probably could cause  I can&#39;t straighten out a problem let it go  go somewhere else  always my bridge partner but that&#39;s different as far as anything else I don&#39;t really argue with people  I don&#39;t argue I don&#39;t like confrontation  my parents of course very very much so  I had great parents  reminder of my parents were at Tuskegee which is a black college they always want me to go to a black college with course I didn&#39;t want to do that annoy  they&#39;re very positive role model for me the certain things that I don&#39;t do today because of them I don&#39;t drink I don&#39;t curse I don&#39;t look down people do but I don&#39;t have as much respect for people who do a lot of either one of those things I love to drive I love to travel and my dad&#39;s always take us someplace every weekend he was up we go somewhere to Chicago Indiana Michigan how much the area we go up the machine pick fruit or we got all our dogs from puppy farms in Indiana that kind of thing I had Uncle lived in Wisconsin who was up very far, so my daddy said love to drive and I love to travel  that&#39;s a hard one  I&#39;ve had a lot of great experiences I think the best one was that we went awry anniversary we went to Europe we went to Paris and we wrote The Orient Express we went from luengo always stand by we went from London to Venice and then flew back to Paris that was probably the best friend I ever had in my life I never really cared for Europe because it&#39;s so much here United States to do in Social America and I&#39;ve been to Alaska and Hawaii but we said it was something different and we always watch it on the Orient Express and we did that expensive but phenomenal drip God wants the one strip mat once-in-a-lifetime just once  not traveling more sooner we did a lot when the kids were younger but  but I think we should have probably done we didn&#39;t do I wish I&#39;d gone because we always have Chicago on Thanksgiving but I think we should have gotten more than just on Thanksgiving my parents come here at Christmas time by the equation of a line. A lot more when it comes to that  yes that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s why I threw regret because it could have been avoided the things we could have done and we spend their time working and more concerned about getting ahead then actually family what&#39;s closest to us  oh yes they definitely  that&#39;s a good question today 20 years ago  I will set up  don&#39;t take things too seriously but don&#39;t be too relaxed over my either  sometimes you cannot take things for granted or Granite nothing is promised  oh heaven forbid  no I have that  no no  no  very very easy I really have no problem with that once in awhile if I am anxious about something I have things coming up through or projects to then I get kind of anxious a little bit I don&#39;t like to be late I don&#39;t like to make mistakes so therefore I do have some anxiety issues which will cause yourself all night to get things done this to make sure that everything right  tired  I don&#39;t get irritable I think I just  massage Maybe  very good I was up late last night so I&#39;m kind of tired now but I usually have no problem sleeping  and I get a good night sleep  no I have not know but it came back out for Christmas break very relaxed now  I have great kids  I have a son at USC  and I have a son at UCLA  and my daughter just got married  so I&#39;m a proud of my really proud of my kids  did they&#39;re going to have a good life  oh yes I enjoyed it I still enjoy it being a parent forever so  taking care of someone else and getting started off to have a good life  I think that that&#39;s rewarding  making sure everything is covered that needs to be kept with your kids weather if they&#39;re eating their sleeping their clothes adjusted for their content that you have no problems at school or at home or at the safe  physically mentally spiritually everything  my best friend was said she has not changed since high school  level-headed but great sense of humor  relaxed I don&#39;t take things too seriously  I love the holidays I love Christmas I love everything about it I love preparing the house for it I loved baking cooking specialty baking I love experimenting with new recipes until the last couple of weeks because of holiday season was just here I feel fantastic everything is quiet I&#39;m not at work I&#39;m not stressed out in any way at all I have no project do I have to think about anyway  so Christmas time holiday time  really enjoyed recently of course we went to Las Vegas 27th of December that was Fantasia I stay for two days we had a really good time we saw a great show we have some great food we drove that we don&#39;t need to drive I don&#39;t like to drive a lot but we drove there and just took our time  it was good it was nice  goodbye thanks for listening house at 1 okay  I have to ring the bell  my mind is wandering here we go  okay  actually

484 okay  yes  I&#39;m doing well  I was born in Oakland  all the different areas of the city the different cultures that are here  the traffic the  lack of public transportation and the superficiality  I I don&#39;t I would love to travel more  being able to experience a different way of living getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspectives  I&#39;m in 2008 I studied abroad in Brazil and that was about four months and I was in Bahia which is in the north and  see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a Homestay family  I&#39;ve always wanted to travel and I chose to Brazil because they have an afro Brazilian population or large after Brazilian population which I really want to learn more about and I think their history and their culture is really interesting  I think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and figuring out where to go  right now I&#39;m getting my masters in social work  dream job I think to consult about mental health and  how to  how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing a research and Consulting work and getting to travel  basically that those would be the main characteristics  I think that&#39;s a false dichotomy but I do consider myself shy but at the same time out going in the sense that I push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and I&#39;m determined to do what it takes to become successful  I listen to music and just lay on my bed and I guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things also breathing exercises which I&#39;m learning more about as well as exercise  pretty good I don&#39;t get angry a lot so as far as angry temperament I&#39;m pretty good at that  what month is this may probably two months ago  and I argued via text message so it&#39;s not really intense arguing but I guess you called arguing in a sentence over whether or not I should be forgiven for something that I thought was minor with a friend I&#39;ve had for a few years  I felt anxious sad and angry  yeah those are the main emotions  I know them because I think I&#39;m pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then I&#39;ll notice the physical manifestations of emotions like if if my heart&#39;s racing or from getting sweaty  if I&#39;m if my breathing is more shallow I&#39;ll know I&#39;m anxious so I&#39;ll know something is bothering me  that I wish I had handled differently  I guess related to this argument I went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and I know that it wasn&#39;t such a big deal but I wish I hadn&#39;t have let myself get to that point  it impacted a relationship and I also felt really bad about what I did  hardest decision  wow probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into I briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards after dropping out I had to really rethink what it is that I wanted to do and what I wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on  I think by recognizing what I don&#39;t want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program  after think  revolving around the same person I&#39;ve spoke of earlier  it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling-out over his treatment of me and involved another person and I wish I could get that out of my mind  I have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the Bay Area I didn&#39;t grow up with her but I&#39;ve gotten closer to her as an adult  we talked pretty regularly with my dad I grew up with him mostly he lives in Atlanta and we don&#39;t talk as much but we are we were pretty soon relationship it&#39;s not really that contentious or anyting and I&#39;m an only child so I don&#39;t have siblings I don&#39;t have a large family I&#39;m so  in general I&#39;m not really that close to family  one person is my mentor who I met in 2005  and she&#39;s a judge and I met her when I was in community college and she really  open my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that I would be able to achieve certain things  is it for you to get it  pretty easy well it&#39;s easy for me to sleep what&#39;s not easy is getting up  because usually I do not look forward to what I have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me want to stay in bed all so I wake up pretty tired and not really feeling refreshed  I think just  self talk about how would I have to do isn&#39;t that bad or that the things that I&#39;m doing now or going to end pretty soon with the end of the school year trying to think of things that I can look forward to in the week also listening to music and browsing the internet kind of gets my mind going  feeling  oh wow feeling emotionally drained in some ways and at the same time feeling like I&#39;ve accomplished a lot and I&#39;ve grown so mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of  feeling accomplished and proud at the same time  no I haven&#39;t  yes  an 2006  the convergence of a lot of stressful factors I was out of touch with my mom I started why I transfer to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really  exacerbated things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where I just felt really overwhelmed  yes I do  yes  I notice I&#39;m better able to  accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them I&#39;m  able to think differently about things that happen maybe look at things in a more positive light  and also identify the areas I need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas  this past weekend I reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again  people have different takes on on me I don&#39;t have one best friend but I think people would describe me as very  analytical  sensitive intelligent  intellectual  I wish that I did not order it I wish I was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which I&#39;m working on and I wish that I had more energy  start going to therapy now  but yeah I really would and  also  to what house am I playing 10 years ago 18 okay so graduating from high school I would tell myself to pick up some more job skills that I wouldn&#39;t have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer idea of what I wanted to do as a career  I think the fact that I&#39;m in grad school and coming from the background that I that I come from low socioeconomic status and just pushing through challenges to get here  thanks for sharing your thoughts  you&#39;re welcome  bye  okay
377 so when she&#39;s finished I&#39;ll just wait for a little more buttons not working I&#39;m pleased  are you okay  yeah go ahead  okay  I grew up in Wisconsin and I lived in Colorado for a bit and then they lived overseas for a little while and then I move to California  I moved here at the end of June of last year so I guess it&#39;s been 8 months something like that  at the most probably twice a year  Well my own town is all of 5,000 people and there are a lot of cows and barns and Farms so the opposite of LA  good question I have always wanted to live in California so but I had to living in in the Central Coast  and I just have been coming down to La like once a month for different business and that working and personal development stuff so yeah things were changing in Santa Cruz for me that client I had who is really the main like Financial  Main Financial Source I had that relationship ended so I was totally free to move and I thought well I guess I&#39;ll give Ally a try and see what happens so  I give it a shot and here I am  no not at all very very big city  I lived in Dublin in Ireland was it which is also a big city but you know European cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy and  yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and  I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer. I love to travel I love it I live in Ireland and I traveled by the Morocco and I was in Costa Rica on my spend some time in Mexico so yeah  I love meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what&#39;s different but seeing what&#39;s similar among people everywhere you go  I want to hear about one of your trips  sure well  I guess trying to think which is my favorite time of night there&#39;s amazing things about Morocco and Costa Rica both but Morocco&#39;s incredible it was like 12 days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains are beautiful and  yeah it&#39;s a really really cool culture that was fun  my trip to Ireland I actually visited there which is why I decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was being in a bison and leaving Dublin and going to sound to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is time is everyone is these pictures of Ireland or you know you see in films and it&#39;s green and Lush and gorgeous but you actually get there and experienced it it&#39;s like the pictures don&#39;t do it justice so incredible  I might have an undergrad degree in English and psychology and a psychology minor and I have a master&#39;s degree in women&#39;s studies  no I use my English in Psychology I work in marketing Communications so actually do sales so yeah the psychology definitely comes in to comes into play and so does my  I guess my undergrad degree in English but really like I took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an English degree just teach and I I wasn&#39;t wanting to teach  what made you decide to do  too cuz I&#39;m not clear on the question  okay  my job  wow  yeah my dream job is  being a  a motivational speaker and trainer and coach  I&#39;m in traveling the world doing that and impacting people&#39;s lives and really contributing to people  my relationships pretty good actually I  I just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic I saw her sporadically growing up I lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and they had two kids together so I grew up and I consider them like the family I grew up with so but I got in communication with my biological mother  last May and we&#39;ve been  clear things up and have been in communication since then  well not sure what you mean but if you&#39;re referring to being communication with my birth mother is very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and they do not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah  I&#39;m shy  time to relax I do a number of things I like to do yoga and I don&#39;t have the money for it right now I love to dance I love to read I love to go to the ocean and spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really retarded is my battery actually probably more than anything else  I like to be with friends I love arts and trying new restaurants  yeah all those things are  both relaxing and I guess they&#39;re relaxing in the sense that I feel connected to the people in my life and today experiences of my life so  yeah  how are you at controlling your temper  depends if I&#39;m driving not very good but otherwise I&#39;m pretty good at it  last night I argued with somebody probably would have to be  Ono is with the LA times that the newspaper delivery  yeah that was the last time  tell me about  yeah the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that I take care of it didn&#39;t show up and I didn&#39;t realize that it wasn&#39;t there until  I&#39;m late I don&#39;t know afternoon I think early afternoon and then I called them and they said they couldn&#39;t send a replacement because it was after 10:30 in the morning which is absurd to me when they made a mistake in the first place so I mean for service at and it would pay for it for every day so I&#39;m yeah I was just really irritated and then I found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so amazing Ricky L E X I was angry with people who&#39;d forwarded the newspaper and didn&#39;t tell me I was pretty frustrated  Noel there quite a few of those  I think about 1  the other day I had a phone call  and I&#39;m going to coaching program and  it was from one of the coaches in the program and she was explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls cuz we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that I was going to have another coaching call with  someone who&#39;s not my couch and that hasn&#39;t been explained to me it&#39;s part of the program so it&#39;s in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my God I have all these people I have to be accountable to and you know I have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just  so yeah I wasn&#39;t  I was an angry I was just I just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and I talked it out with her and we got through it but  yeah I could have  certainly just been okay with what for was being asked of me in the at that time and would have made the call go a lot smoother  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to make  large decision while there&#39;s been a few  why is moving to Ireland was probably the hardest decision now it wasn&#39;t even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging  that was the hardest decision was the first time that I  moved away from my family I was 28 and I decided to I chose to move to Colorado and that&#39;s a pretty tough decision at that point my family had been within an hour&#39;s Drive of where I lived an hour hour-and-a-half and now they&#39;re going to be a 12-hour drive away or a plane right away so that was challenging  oh lots of things  I love Colorado Colorado is beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than Wisconsin and at the time I was very much into rock climbing and there&#39;s just a huge outdoor outdoor community in Colorado so they were a lot more people who were in my age group and or single that was another factor and we&#39;re interested in the things I was interested in so Colorado to seem like a really natural fit hell yeah and then I found a job that I liked the pay was atrocious but I found some work that was really rewarding and that all came together just move  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  I was totally unrelated question  relatively easily it just depends on like what time I go to sleep if I&#39;m out and I don&#39;t get home until 11:30 then  and having to go to bed late and I wake up feeling tired like I feel today but generally I can sleep through the night I&#39;ve had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks but even so even when I wake up from those are five-star from those I still can fall back to sleep relatively easily  I&#39;m sure they are I mean I&#39;m in another transition state and moving out of  out of the house that I live in right now or take care of an elderly woman  yeah and I just I have to find  the financial means to support me in doing that and it&#39;s and she creates a lot of anxiety just didn&#39;t her state of being anxious exhausting and I&#39;d really depressing  living with her is pretty hard like it&#39;s probably the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever done and I would never ever choose to do it again if I honestly if I knew what I was getting into I don&#39;t think I would have said yes to the situation  I feel trapped and helpless like this nothing I can  no way out of the situation that I&#39;m in no matter what I do it doesn&#39;t get any better I did I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not getting any kind of work that I want to do and my money&#39;s not working at all  so yeah I feel pretty crappy  I have in the past year  oh a long time I was 15 I think 14 so it was over 20 years ago  are you suicidal  you feel down  oh yeah I fell down  I don&#39;t actually now  well I originally stopped  with my therapist because we had completed I mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and I was no longer depressed and and then I began therapy again later on think I wish it was in my early thirties and then I we ended that because I moved to Ireland so  yeah I&#39;m in depending on the therapist and sitting on your intention like I I don&#39;t go into therapy thinking I&#39;m going to be in this therapeutic relationship for the next 10 years I think that&#39;s ridiculous  I think you going to therapy to work on a specific problem and I have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board you can see things that you can&#39;t see and  we not work through that situation and come up with  a strategy for notches that not just in creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and tools for the rest of your life so that you don&#39;t have to be in therapy forever  tell me about the last time you got  can I feel really happy  Zoe Sierra go  no that&#39;s not true it was when I  saw my biological mother which was last May  my best qualities  I&#39;m very strong  very strong-willed  I  very supportive and loving and nurturing I&#39;m easy to be around I&#39;m intelligence  and  is there anything you regret  I don&#39;t think so  now  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  don&#39;t take life too seriously  how ideal weekend, spend some time at the beach and spend some time with friends  either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to  a club or bar somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together maybe go dancing after and Sundays I usually go to  and then I have brunch with friends and  may I go home and Sunday night and get ready for the next day so  I am most proud of  a few things that mean I&#39;ve moved to places that I wanted to move to and so I&#39;ve done things that have really spoken to me and if meant something been dear to my heart to actually  achieve those those  goals are those  yeah I&#39;ve done things that I wanted to do like move to Ireland and move to California  okay

about  family  oh wow  I came from a dysfunctional family I really don&#39;t have many Family Values  me and my brother 13 years apart in age so I really don&#39;t know my brother that well  so I really don&#39;t know much of a family life we never sat down at the table together and had meals together it was always like separate times when we come in and eat another one would come in and eat we never sat down at the same table  so I don&#39;t know much about family life  I listen to music  and  I listen to relaxing relaxation music like Chimes a brook water running stuff like that  how are you  I&#39;m on medication right now I get aggravated really easily mood swings personality disorder but sometimes it just flares up depending on the situation of somebody gets in my face but I try not to let it happen cuz I know the circumstances  when was the last time you argue with them  Wheels on the Bus  I was sitting in the back on the bus and the guy came back and he wanted me to move for he could sit down but I&#39;m a big guy and he&#39;s a big guy so I decided just to get up and let him have a seat I didn&#39;t want to get no confrontation I just let it go  that had to be meeting a girl that I&#39;ve known for 18 years  she&#39;s had two children with this guy and  now the guys going to be part of the family and I feel very comfortable about that  but I still have feelings for this girl but I know that the father of the boys but not married he&#39;s going to be involved with the family and I I don&#39;t like that  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  that&#39;s a good one back in 2010 I went back from my mom&#39;s funeral and my brother was hard up for money  and he took his Ira out and spend it and I have promised him I was going to pay him back I wasn&#39;t able to pay him back and he held it against me so I felt guilty about that because I made a promise and I didn&#39;t keep it but there was more circumstances into that and he doesn&#39;t understand he didn&#39;t write to me he didn&#39;t call me he didn&#39;t do a lot of things  tell me about the hardest decision  the hardest decision I ever had to make  was when I was with the merchant marines I was very comfortable being at sea  and my wife at the time she wanted me to stop sailing and just get a regular nine-to-five job where I would have been very comfortable staying at Sea and working on ships cuz I love that that was what I loved but she didn&#39;t like that so she&#39;d rather me work 9 to 5  tell me about new bed or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  dead bodies I always see a lot of dead bodies  I had circumstances in the military where I recovered a dead body in the Philippines a boy had jumped ship and we recovered the body underneath the pier and I had to pull the body out and put it in a body bag and another incident was in boot camp  there was a circumstances were me and this guy got letters all the time from our girls but he was engaged and he committed suicide because  the girl dumped him for another guy and a crush them and he end up jumping 3 ft in front of me while I was in Barracks Duty and I seen his head explode like pumpkin and it affected me greatly I see that all the time  have you ever served in the middle  yes I was in the Navy 15 years  into with the merchant marines  24  family thing my

scared when I first joined I was kind of scared but then we join the military and made me a lot tougher and stronger I stood up for my own grounds I wasn&#39;t being pushed around  and  I just like people applauding when you would walk into a place and they would appreciate what you did for your country  made it all worthwhile  depressed  mood swings  high anxiety  isolation  I have no social life  I don&#39;t have much of a communication with women I don&#39;t know how to act around them  so I&#39;d like to say to myself  have you noticed any changes  getting out more  before I was always

463 okay cool  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  yes I am  I am pretty good  I was born in Los Angeles California  yes  I like the fact that everything is closed by all the stores and shops  the traffic  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot of trouble but not too much  going away from your usual days exploring new sites  3 weeks notice a month ago I went to Las Vegas with me and my friends and we just went sightseeing  in Las Vegas we went to the Hoover Dam and it was breathtaking the it was really big and we saw the Big Canyon and it was impressive I never seen something like that before  I studied nursing  I graduated two months ago so I took my board exam to be licensed and I passed so I&#39;m just waiting for my license in the mail  my dream job is to be a registered nurse  long time ago when I was a little boy I got injured and my parents had to take me to the hospital and the doctors came by and they had to stitch me up on the leg and I saw all of that and that made me want to pursue the medical field  are you happy  yes I am very happy  my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it&#39;s if it&#39;s in between  I am close I am very close to them if I have a problem or I go to them for help  someone who&#39;s been a positive influence has been my best friend since elementary school  yes  yes we&#39;ve known each other since we were in the third grade and we&#39;ve we&#39;ve gone to a lemon tree middle school and high school together and he lives like two blocks away so he&#39;s basically like like a brother of mine  I am shy  I really don&#39;t know I&#39;ve always been a quiet person ever since I can remember  what do I do if I  I going to my room I turn my AC on and I just relax in my bed  I am pretty good I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my temper yes  the last time I argued with someone was about  work  I was disappointed not angry just disappointed  because my manager he wanted me to do something faster than what I usually can handle and he already knew that my workload was a lot but he didn&#39;t understand that so that made me just very like sad  I cannot remember one  the hardest decision I ever had to make was  dropping out of school  I felt that I didn&#39;t really belong far away from home and so I was just thinking ahead I was in a major that I didn&#39;t really like and so  I decided to just not go next semester and go back home to LA  are you happy  right now that I&#39;m looking at it yes I am very happy that I did that because I wouldn&#39;t have gone to nursing school and I wouldn&#39;t have been a licensed vocational nurse right now  I don&#39;t have an event  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it depends on the days where I work or where I don&#39;t work  yes right now I I work at at a retail store early in the morning I I go at 3 in the morning and I get out at 10 a.m. so it&#39;s really hard for me to get a good night sleep  when I don&#39;t sleep well I can be a little bit grumpy irritated or just frustrated with the situation  lately I&#39;ve been okay I&#39;m been good  no I have not  okay  no  no  the last time I was really really happy and excited was when I found out that I passed my license board exam to be a nurse  my best friend would have just would describe me as a caring nice sweet shy quiet guy  physically speaking I would change how I look from the outside  I am overweight and I would like to lose some weight and just look good from the outside  I don&#39;t have one  no I don&#39;t  just one time  I at my work it&#39;s a retail store I kind of took some merchandise without buying it  what made you decide to do that  it was a risk that I took but since no one was around and D up the opportunity was right there for me to get it I just got it and I took it home  I don&#39;t know  yes last weekend I went to I went yard selling with my family and it was pretty fun going out to different yard sales and finding random stuff  I bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was on it was only for $2 and so I got it and now it&#39;s in my room and I sit on it  I am most proud of is the fact that I am a nurse that I am a nurse I&#39;m just waiting for my for my license in the mail and after that I would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and call Aunt nursing homes  I think I got everything I need  thanks for sharing your thoughts  bye

Or people were like really rude you know with the way they cut you off  almost  luckily not you know I&#39;m very assertive and maybe too much sometimes we&#39;re if somebody does something really rude to me in a parking lot I&#39;ll I&#39;ll confront them on that sometimes  might have been with my sister  I had to do with I&#39;m not sure of the topic but whatever she was saying wasn&#39;t right and we got in an argument it sounds childish about who was right you know cuz she thinks she&#39;s always the smarter one cuz she&#39;s older  sometimes it&#39;s frustrating cuz it&#39;s like it&#39;s a no-win situation she just wants to hammer on somebody till you know they acknowledged that she&#39;s right other times I just let it go and let her ride along cuz it&#39;s  those kind of non productive  I&#39;m real close to I see my parents almost every weekend more close to my mother  I have a twin sister I stay in touch with her even though she&#39;s out of town she lives out of town and I&#39;ve got two other sister so I stay in touch with all of them you know it&#39;s a mixed bag you know  be kind of assertive aggressiveness in us in a little bit  but also  well me and ever I mean stranger sometimes my family you know they&#39;ve done nice things for me to strangers have been very sometimes unexpectedly very nice  I could be shopping and you know maybe I can&#39;t reach something and some guy I&#39;ll pop up behind me and you know without me saying anything just help me out  that type of thing or  if somebody&#39;s like kind of mean to me somebody all like commiserate you know  anti  I had a situation years ago with a neighbor where he was really nasty to me cuz he thought I didn&#39;t like his dog was you know I&#39;m not crazy about dogs but he kind of flipped out for a year-and-a-half and just said very nasty things to me when other people weren&#39;t around I wish I had confronted that back then because I yeah but it create a lot of anxiety for me cuz I feel like I could have nipped it in the bud and instead of having to deal with the  major stress from it now he and I don&#39;t talk at all I just feel it&#39;s best it&#39;s kind of odd  God there&#39;s been a lot  sometimes breaking up with somebody or  yeah Sushi or getting rid of a friend  that type of thing  sometimes I feel guilty about some of my past Behavior with people  or maybe I wasn&#39;t his understanding  when I was younger I stole things you know that&#39;s not the best behavior and  kind of stuff like that  oh God there&#39;s a lot of them  I wish I could have raised you know how tough my dad was on us as children  and erase a lot of memories of men I dated that just didn&#39;t work out well at all  now  I can drop off like right away  cranky irritated  snarky  I&#39;ve been out of sorts some I&#39;ve had some anxiety with money and relationships cuz I haven&#39;t been in one for so long male  just a lot of anxiety  take a deep breath trying to do positive things so you know sometimes eat healthy or work out more talk to my friend about it  that type of thing try and look for interesting activities to do to distract me  will not officially but I know you know from things have experience that I&#39;ve had you not get very anxious and certain situations  yeah it&#39;s usually triggered by  sometimes if somebody gets really angry and crazy it triggers a lot of anxiety in me if they&#39;re aggressive whether it be physically or verbally or sometimes if they&#39;re too much in my my space you know where I am if it bothers me  yeah a long time ago  ages ago  maybe over 10 years ago 15 years ago  I was depressed I mean it&#39;s nothing to laugh about but I mean it&#39;s kind of  a circle just to want to be more positive and enjoy life more  feeling stuck in certain thoughts I&#39;m having a lot of negative thoughts feeling of hopelessness helplessness  that type of thing  I go occasionally it&#39;s a different type I&#39;ll go see a hypnotherapist sometimes to release anxiety that&#39;s in me  yes I do very useful  I want more awareness of myself and other people  learning more control more confidence better self-esteem willing to try even more things you know whether I know the outcome or not you know of the unknown I&#39;ll experiment a lot more  helping like at the 25th mile heading out water and there are some people there who are doing that for the first time also  some event at my sister&#39;s where they were just a couple of us and I was cracking a lot of jokes sometimes I&#39;m like really funny you know and I can&#39;t even believe myself and I just go on and you know that one starts laughing I&#39;m not even trying to and I&#39;m just saying like regular stories and people look at me funny laugh yeah  as a really decent loyal empathetic deserving  supportive I&#39;m hoping  outgoing quirky type of person  look be great to look even younger or be younger  if that was humanly possible  be even more patient with people I think you know not get frustrated like if I think somebody is not very smart sometimes it&#39;s real frustrating for me to be around some types of people  well  wow  make a lot of money and plan for your future  and  try and be as kind of impatient with people as possible and have a lot of fun trying new things  I think of my mind and my perseverance that I&#39;ve changed a lot of things within my personality  I feel proud of volunteer work I feel proud I felt a bunch of people lose weight declutter their homes and helped create a lot of positive change in people  okay  it was nice talking to you  when she nods her head a lot
402 okay great  yeah  how weird  therapist that she talked back oh my gosh wow  and I&#39;ll explain after this is over how it all works just like nobody like making her do anything  are you can tell me later okay  okay so what do I do just do what she says  okay  and you said if I don&#39;t want to answer I can just I don&#39;t want to answer  the wild okay cool thank you okay  are you okay with that  yes  so how are you doing today  okay  Atlanta Georgia  in 2006  never  I don&#39;t like it there  it&#39;s completely boring and there&#39;s very little to do la is preferable I think to most places  because I was engaged to my fiance and we lived in Florida I moved there to be with him and he loves the water but I love the mountains I missed hiking and I love Florida and he wasn&#39;t tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere where we can both be happy and also have more opportunities in business and  all of the great things that I have to offer  very  easy  there&#39;s not much I don&#39;t like about la I love La I think it feels magical so many creative different people of all ages shapes sizes colors races the mountains of water  the city all the things that there are to do all of the different people there are to meet I just I love everything about la  no  I&#39;d rather not talk about it  I didn&#39;t go to college  I&#39;m still figuring that out  I don&#39;t know it may may have something to do with animals I have a dog that I really loved and I never had a dog as an adult I had cats and  I think I&#39;m a late bloomer so I&#39;m working on that whole conversation I don&#39;t I really don&#39;t want a job I want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run  it depends on the situation but in general I consider myself more Scheib although most people would consider me to be outgoing  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver  what do you do  put on classical music music classical music especially stressed and play with my dog  go for a walk  I think I&#39;m really good at controlling my temper  for the most part  before I came here it was just about them  Financial stress  there&#39;s probably a lot of examples I think I&#39;d rather move to another question  yeah I&#39;d rather not talk about that either  I&#39;d rather not talk about that  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  not very easy at all  I&#39;m a lot better recently but I have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so it&#39;s challenging not to feel rested most of the time  in the past week I&#39;ve been feeling a lot better  tell me about that  yes I  the weather has changed spring has sprung it&#39;s a little warmer as having more trouble with my depression in the winter and having trouble with tolerating cold and so I wasn&#39;t doing a lot of the things that I normally do and I also was sick with the flu and in the past week I decided that I was feeling better enough that I needed to kind of get out of my rut and start getting more focused around things that I need to do during the day and walking my dog everyday and not isolating so much  sing some of my friends more so I was feeling I&#39;ve been feeling a lot better like I&#39;ve been making progress and that  in the past week things have taken a more positive turn  no  yes  it&#39;s been quite some time of officially it&#39;s probably been  I don&#39;t know exactly but let&#39;s see  maybe more than 15 years ago  I was feeling suicidal  no  because I found a better alternative  I&#39;ve been there be off and on since I was 18 and I&#39;m tried a variety of methods and then I started working with some neuro-linguistic programming her and that was really the first person that helped me  make permanent changes and I was able to get off my antidepressants as well and even though I struggle with some bouts of depression it&#39;s never been anything extremely severe and I was one of the best things that ever happened  well I was physically ill with chronic fatigue syndrome and I had a client that referred me to this person because he had cured her of that disease and  that was he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so  once I had my first conversation with him I knew it was the right step for me  I&#39;m so happy  I felt like I was some  I felt that  I found the answer that I&#39;ve been looking for that I hadn&#39;t given up hope  panda  I would like I&#39;m glad 9 that I had been suffering for a long time and I felt that I finally  found  the answer to the  solution that I was looking for I was like  every last thing I ever did in my life or the best decision I ever made  extremely helpful for the first time in a long time  I went to  I went to a music store  because I&#39;ve been thinking about I&#39;m taking up an instrument I used to play the violin as a child and I&#39;ve been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because I felt it&#39;s been extremely depressed and numb  that&#39;s how I went to the music store to try out to see what it would feel like to  to handle and the instrument again and see if I thought that that was something that I would want to pursue  it was awesome  yeah I&#39;d rather not talk about that  well  that&#39;s probably a lot but  I&#39;m always working on being more optimistic  it&#39;s been challenging it takes time but  I wish I could hear my own  internal voice better  yeah I have regrets sure  value myself more so that I would make better  relationship decisions  my fiance is the most positive  person in my life my My ultimate supporter  tell me about  I think very unique not the  not at all selfish and the  probably a little too giving for his butt  always has my best interest at heart has the highest morals of anyone I know would give somebody the shirt off of his back is a genius and so many ways and  I&#39;m pretty lucky I think  that  I&#39;m not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time I haven&#39;t given up on  taking risks and
446 okay thank you  yes  I&#39;m wonderful how are you  California  yes  the weather is one of them I have the food and the way I everything is centrally located  the traffic the smog  and  it&#39;s just gotten really really overcrowded  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes  I wouldn&#39;t say a lot but I do try to travel at least once once or twice every two years  just exploring different things and being able to have different experiences things of that nature and no learning new things and I&#39;m just different cultures that I like to learn about different cultures and when you travel you get a sense of you no feedback from different cultures and different areas so I like that  well I just came from Miami I last year I went to Miami for a week and a half it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going and it was wonderful the people are really nice and it was really a great experience I went out there for a particular event they have something every year I&#39;m where everyone comes out from all over and they just kind of party and hang out and meet new people was really fun  well from that trip I would say  swimming and the beautiful beautiful beautiful Miami Beach Waters was wonderful  yeah it was  child development  well  I&#39;ve always been interested in children since I was younger my baby&#39;s had a lot so I had a lot of experience with kids at a young age and As I Grew Older I realize that it was something that I like to do so that&#39;s when I am looking to Child Development courses and I thought that it was something like that I wouldn&#39;t enjoy doing so I started taking classes and the rest of History  I have gas it&#39;s been 15 years in August  yeah  my dream job  I would say  to become a principal  what is something that I thought about doing for a while now and I&#39;ve actually just began the steps to try to get that going so very back in school and I&#39;m going to be taking courses I&#39;m so that I can make that happen because it is a dream of mine thank you  it&#39;s going to be pretty difficult there is several years of schooling that I have ahead of me and you know it&#39;s definitely going to be a challenge but it&#39;s something that I&#39;m up for because it is a dream job of mine so it&#39;s something that I&#39;m willing to I&#39;m willing to do  a little bit of both I think a little bit of both I can be shy at times  in and out going as well but I think a little bit of both I would say  what do you do  I meditate I I&#39;m a big big meditator so I love meditating I love just reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time  oh wow I&#39;m very very good at that very good at controlling my temper I again series of meditations that I do it involves deep breathing and just really censoring yourself to where you can feel your heartbeat and you can really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot  oh wow it was just recently actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and  it was about  just the way he responds sometimes to me I can be a little aggressive and we&#39;re just trying to work with that because I don&#39;t respond well to aggression I totally tune out and that&#39;s actually would happen so yeah that was it  I felt very frustrated  and I actually felt angered to but more frustrated and I felt fat and too because I don&#39;t like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions that one time  the situation watch I wish I would have handled differently  honestly I haven&#39;t had a situation like that and 20 years I&#39;ve pretty much kind of  you know kind of mastered more responses to certain  stimuli I kind of got that down  tell me about  the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make while it was when I was 16 years old and I became a teenage mother I was pregnant at 16 and I had a lot of pressure from family to give my child up for adoption or to abort and I chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions is not the hardest decisions to make as a 16 year old teenage teenager just whether I wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether I wanted to embark on raising a life when I was just a child myself so that I think was the hardest decision  I had to make  well I mean my son is almost 19 now so it&#39;s 19 years later and I actually am so glad it was one of the best things that I ever did by not choosing to avoid him and chew being pro-life pro-choice pro-life and  and I have not regretted the decision that&#39;s my only child and I love him he is just a blessing he&#39;s just a blessing and I feel very special to be his mom  I do oh yeah  I know it&#39;s it&#39;s not easy it definitely has its difficulties I&#39;m just as anything but at the end of the day it is really rewarding and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you&#39;ve raised become productive citizen and go out in society and start making their way and it&#39;s really rewarding it really is  oh wow so many ways  the first what are the first way is I actually listen to my son and I are accepted feedback even if I don&#39;t like it and I allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when I was little there was not a lot of conversation from parent to child it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it and with my son I give him options allow him to express itself allow him to give me feedback or negative or positive because I feel that it&#39;s really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and that&#39;s parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of make sure that you nurture that because that&#39;s kind of  the way that they develop me now and it&#39;s really really important so I&#39;m different and I and a lot of ways and that right  thank you  well  it depends sometimes it&#39;s it really depends it depends on the time that I go to sleep it depends on the time that I woke up so it&#39;s a lot of factors I can&#39;t just give you one answer I would say that  it varies sometimes I can go to sleep and fall asleep right away and other times I can go to sleep and it might take a while to actually fall asleep so it varies  I&#39;ve been feeling great lately I&#39;ve I really have been  I can&#39;t say that work for the last week didn&#39;t affect me you know the argument with my husband but other than that I have been feeling really good  no I haven&#39;t  no I have not  you know what honestly I feel happy everyday you know everyday I wake up I&#39;m happy because that is a chance for me to  take advantage Carpe Diem seize the day so I feel blessed every morning I wake up it&#39;s a blessing you know because I realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and that&#39;s not me so I feel really really blessed everyday  thank you  as nurturing patient loving friendly  kind of reserved  well I wish that I had already completed college and had my Master&#39;s Degree and sometimes I wish I was a little bit more knowledgeable and certain subjects  and I can change that if I could change anything I would change that those two things and also I would be a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert  you know what no regrets no regrets you live and learn nothing is perfect everything that I&#39;ve gone through has made me the person that I am today so I wouldn&#39;t change anything because I&#39;m happy with the person that I am today  oh man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before relationship even before your career I really really would have told myself to stay focused and to get a great education  I&#39;m most proud of  where I come from  as a Teenage mother being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same I&#39;ve had my same job for 15 years now I&#39;m really proud of that I&#39;ve been married for 13 years I&#39;m really proud of that happily married to my best friend of my soulmate and nothing is perfect but he&#39;s my best friend and I love them and I&#39;m also proud of my son being the mother that I am in the Sun that I&#39;ve raised I&#39;m proud of the job but I&#39;ve done and I&#39;m  I really applaud myself for that  you&#39;re welcome you were wonderful thank you  bye-bye  hi  okay
352 next  are you okay  yes  I&#39;m doing pretty good  I&#39;m from Oklahoma  yep Oklahoma City  the weather is great I love being near the ocean and the palm trees and mountains I just love it here  I was pretty easy there&#39;s a few differences of huge City compared to where I&#39;m from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me  I just always wanted to live in California hated being landlocked in Oklahoma and just wanted to get out to the West Coast be near the ocean  I studied psychology and minor in art  no not at the moment  well actually I think I misunderstood your question I&#39;m not still working on my degree but I am working in the field of psychology I know I just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys to has been in trouble with the law  my dream job  I don&#39;t really know I think I just want to help people however I can and I just like working with people in the realm of psychology so I think I may already have my dream job  to relax I like to read and watch movies I like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or hang out with friends  what are some things that  things that make me really mad probably Injustice towards other people people being mistreated or abused and people being lied to and deceived including myself I hate being lied to  limonoid depends on the situation but I tried to just like count to 10 and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions caused me to react in a negative way so I just try and like calm down before I say anything  it depends again on the situation and like who I&#39;m angry with most the time I&#39;m pretty good at controlling it but sometimes I think like like most people I lash out at the people that I&#39;m close to the stew at times and those moments I&#39;m not that good at controlling it  when was the last time I argue with someone was probably with my parents I&#39;ve been having some car trouble lately and I&#39;m also running low on money so I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t even remember exactly but I&#39;m sure we kind of probably thought about the fact that I you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent and take care of my own things like car issues  I&#39;m very close with my family they&#39;re still in Oklahoma but I talked to them on the phone all the time  oh definitely I mean my mom I think she&#39;s probably the person that I&#39;m closest to and she just she&#39;s a great role model she&#39;s a wonderful person and she&#39;s very hardworking and very unselfish and I just want to be like her in those ways  probably the time I went bungee jumping over the Nile River and Uganda I still kind of have flashbacks of that moment just Free Falling it was like the coolest experience ever and I love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time  yeah well I I have traveled a lot nowadays I don&#39;t travel so much anymore but I used to work for a Cruise Line Norwegian Cruise Line so I would go travel all the time with them and then I also did an 11 month long trip around the world is a mission trip so I just went and helped out and different third world countries is really cool  I just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people because it&#39;s easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there&#39;s a huge world out there and there&#39;s all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it&#39;s just really cool to be able to Branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity in the terrain of the earth even in the way that the earth looks in different places is cool  no I have not served in the military  nope  no I never been formally diagnosed although I would say I probably diagnose myself with depression just after having studied at a lot in Psychology throughout the years I&#39;ve probably 99% sure that I have struggled with depression and off-and-on so yeah  lately it&#39;s been pretty easy but throughout the years I&#39;ve definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now I&#39;m not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it&#39;s definitely been an ongoing issue for me  I&#39;m not a private person when I don&#39;t sleep well leave is extremely like important for me I think maybe more so than a lot of people I&#39;d I like need good sleep to function  I&#39;ve been feeling really good over the past several months I was unemployed after coming out here and that was really really tough and I just recently got offered my job just like last week so I definitely think I&#39;ve been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it&#39;s like lifted a lot of has lifted off of me because I don&#39;t have that pressure any longer of like how am I going to make ends meet the city&#39;s really expensive and I don&#39;t have a job and so I feel I feel much more relieved than I have been feeling just good  yeah well I mean just like I said over the past week or so I&#39;ve become a lot more positive I was kind of like feeling a bit like a Hermit in a way it&#39;s just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like I said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of  just like being your own shall I guess and that was kind of how it was how it&#39;s been for me and just since I got offered a job I just have so much more confidence in like positivity that things are starting to work out for me up to good  probably a couple of days ago actually I went I went to explore part of the South Bay Area that I hadn&#39;t really been to before and it was I was just going to go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and it was just beautiful and then I went for a drive up kind of off the Sleep Cliff for the beautiful scenery that I never seen before and I just like was overwhelmed how pretty it was and I was just like I can&#39;t believe that I get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me  my best friend would probably say that I&#39;m very daring and bold and fearless that I&#39;m unique and artistic and I don&#39;t I&#39;ve guess I should probably say that I&#39;m a non-conformist I don&#39;t really think the way that a lot of people do and I question everything so it&#39;s going to be a good or bad thing but  probably just like the fact that I I really tried to live my life with like no regrets and just I tried to live a very exciting life in a way and I think that especially ever since I finished college and have been traveling like I haven&#39;t I&#39;ve tried moving all different places by myself so I think just the fact that I am not really afraid I don&#39;t let things hold me back I just if I want something or if I want to do something I just do it and I guess in a way like I like that about myself in the fact that I&#39;m really independent and can just go and do whatever I feel like doing even if it&#39;s hard I still I&#39;m proud that I&#39;ve overcome a lot of those struggles  oh there&#39;s like minor things that I regret throughout my life but there&#39;s not anything really major cuz I think pretty much everything that I&#39;ve done I&#39;ve learned from whether it&#39;s good or bad so I wouldn&#39;t really change anything  I would say I would tell myself when I was a kid that I  should just keep dreaming big and don&#39;t let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything is possible because I guess as I&#39;ve grown into an adult I&#39;ve really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and then if you really want something you can go after and you can get it and so I would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you want to do  let&#39;s see that&#39;s kind of hard  oh I guess I went home recently for Christmas back to Oklahoma and I got to see some of my friends from college that I hadn&#39;t seen in some of them I haven&#39;t seen in like since I graduated so much has been like 4 years ago so it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun  you&#39;re welcome by  okay  did she stay up and look okay during that hotel
339 and I want to start up the virtual human to chat with you for a bit and when she said she&#39;ll let you know I&#39;ll put the  okay  yes  I&#39;m okay  I was born in San Bernardino California  yes  I&#39;m staying with her sister in North Hollywood  she makes it as comfortable as possible  oh I love the weather  and the entertainment and the public transportation  it&#39;s very difficult to find full-time employment  and some of the people aren&#39;t as friendly as people from the South cuz I lived in the South before  knossos only two things  no I don&#39;t  I was an English major in college  I haven&#39;t finished yes I am  I&#39;d like to be a recording singer  yes  I&#39;ve always loved to sing from the time that I was a child  at times  tell me about  when I&#39;m alone I am extremely  I guess I would say  intermind it like I have a lot of thoughts and I keep them to myself  so  if I&#39;m in that mode then I don&#39;t really interact with people but I can also in a wreck with people if I change modes  I&#39;ve just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago  and  last week on Thursday no on Tuesday  usually I  just try to remain quiet and listen to the situation if it&#39;s a person or if it&#39;s a situation that I&#39;m dealing with myself that&#39;s annoying I try to think of alternate ways that would make the situation better  come up with alternate plans so I won&#39;t be annoyed  pretty good  I may have had an argument a few weeks ago just about timeliness like meeting on time and showing up on time and it was actually last Monday  no  to just be cautious of people&#39;s intentions  then to listen really well cuz people usually tell you what their intentions are without even realizing it  I&#39;m a good listener patient fun-loving  generous  depressed sometimes  but generally a good person  no I have not  yes  found within a year-and-a-half ago  I just knew that  I often thought about situations that happened in the past and  kind of blame the situation for my future and all  certain settings  I&#39;m if I see certain types of individuals and certain settings it just reminds me of when I was younger when things happened and changed my future plans so I tried it I used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time but now I feel like I just handled things better as far as  being in the similar settings with similar people I just handled those things better  I do  I&#39;d like to believe that it does  I don&#39;t worry as much  it&#39;s just allow me to know that actually speaking about the issues  Release Me of the tension of holding them inside so  that&#39;s how it&#39;s helped me  at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it  it actually is good because I know that when things are occurring if I&#39;m able to communicate about them with a certain individual it relieves me of the stress of of a trying to figure out everything alone and oftentimes by speaking about the issues it allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be better just because I&#39;m hearing myself speak up the issue  I was diagnosed with depression and my doctor felt that I should probably see the therapist  I am  it depends if I&#39;m really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do I often try to plan things and if I&#39;m planning things it affect my sleep I might wake up in the middle of the night so  sometimes it&#39;s easy and sometimes it isn&#39;t  irritable  just very irritable  I was feeling anxious but now I&#39;m calmer  today I don&#39;t but I have in the past week  because I was in the midst of searching for a stable place to live and it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so I was becoming anxious  thank you  yes  maybe in October  when my mother first came and she came to visit me in October and when she first got here we had a good time the first couple of days so I was happy to see her I hadn&#39;t seen her in over a year  I&#39;m proud that I&#39;m able to adjust to different situations the older I&#39;ve gotten the more adapt the bowl I am in different environments in different situations and learned how to be more resourceful so I&#39;m proud of that  I&#39;m sorry  my dad my sister she&#39;s positive cuz she&#39;s finished her master&#39;s degree  my mom sometime my best friend is very positive cuz she just started her new business two years ago and she&#39;s very enthusiastic about it that&#39;s an inspiration  when someone lies consistently  I listened very very well sometimes I give good advice I&#39;m a good friend I normally do the things that I say I&#39;m going to do so I&#39;m Dependable my communicate well and  I enjoy people&#39;s company most of the time especially if they&#39;re in Good Moods  being around positive people music foot me in a good mood comedy shows put me in a good mood good food puts me in a good mood  when I graduated from high school  it was a really good I&#39;ll never forget it was wonderful day  very confident accomplished and I was extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future  you&#39;re welcome
629 to respond to you and keep  Mount taal Interactive  expressions in your posture  I&#39;m so lonely  will she pick up on my  fight  okay  okay  so two things  Booker  everyone  absolutely okay  and so she can ask you a series of questions and then at the end she&#39;ll say goodbye and then you&#39;ll press this button  yes  I&#39;m doing quite well  I am from West Covina California  the sports teams I like the Lakers the Dodgers and the USC football  and  and the weather  the traffic don&#39;t like the traffic at all and  other than that it&#39;s probably probably probably yet  no not right now I am in a job that they&#39;re just commute back and forth about 12 miles so that&#39;s about as the extent of my traveling  what do I enjoy about traveling probably seeing new places when I due to trouble seeing new places and people from different states different countries and picking up on their cultures  one of my trips let&#39;s see  I have a friend in Atlanta Georgia and he works for the TV that work down there and when the Dodgers were playing in Atlanta I took a trip to go see him and we went to go see the games as well Atlanta is a good nice Sports Town hot and muggy but we could deal with it as much like here the expressways are about the same traffic they have their own traffic problems but it was really good experience I got to see and meet people from Atlanta Georgia and it was really nice time  one of my most memorable experiences is being in the Marine Corps and liberating Kuwait  that was probably the one of the the best experiences of my of my life  we had a little resistance and trouble from Saudi Arabia into Kuwait and liberate Kuwait City and there was it was great  what I studied at school basically was broadcasting and the radio and cuz I was a radio operator in the Marine Corps so I could study broadcasting I am but I also love history  what do you do now  what do I do now I am a part-time broadcaster for  and it is  and basically operator engineer and run all the programming from satellite sources and a lot of programs  what is my dream job good question probably  similar to what I have in the Marine Corps I was a Sergeant Marine Corps had my own Squad so if I could have being in a management position where I have my own crew and take care of my own crew and look after their needs that would probably be my dream position  it depends on the kind of mood I&#39;m in sometimes I am I feel shy and just want to stay home other times I&#39;m a little  outgoing I want to go out with my friends and and go to dinner and have drinks and watch a sporting event  why cuz I&#39;m feeling good and I want to feel company of my friends and just want to talk and Converse  how good relationship with my family my mother is like one of my best friends I have confide in her with basically all of my problems and good things my dad is is very good man we get along very well and I have three sisters that the two of them I see on a regular basis and one of them I really don&#39;t but we&#39;re all we&#39;re close family  I know it&#39;s  what do I do to relax  is a my apartment complex I have a Jacuzzi so I spend 20 minutes in the jacuzzi and go for a swim afterwards or I will go on a bike ride I have my own mountain bike and I like to travel 5 miles then get to work out it so when I&#39;m feeling since I go get a workout  concussion I&#39;m sometimes it&#39;s it&#39;s very hard but I have to look at myself in and limit myself on what the possible consequences of an uproar of my upper could could lead to so whether to be with my family or my co-workers I have to always look at my soft before I get very angry and and temperament that temperamental  no I don&#39;t think so no  a good question last time I got into argument  was probably with my Dad we I go visit my parents and they have a pool and a pond trying to clean the pool we had a disagreement so we had an argument  a situation where I wish I was at sea  I was  downsize from a full-time position back in December of 2012  and I think I could have probably avoided it if I read the signs probably work a little harder and  and probably  I don&#39;t know  I&#39;m done a better job at that position  something I feel guilty about  ask a question I don&#39;t think I feel really guilty everything I have done I have  lived up to you and not felt guilty about having wrong to anybody  in particular  and that not that I feel guilty I don&#39;t feel guilty about everything  hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make sure she probably when I was 17 years old sign a contract to join the Marine Corps and it was a six-year contract and  I know that was probably a lot for my family but it&#39;s something I wanted to do but it was a really hard one and  I made it and I live through it the six years and I think I am better for  something I could have erased from my memory at sea  let&#39;s see I&#39;m trying to think  probably  I&#39;ve got into to bar fights so probably limiting the alcohol use some of those some of those times and avoided trouble in the bars  yes I have  I was 18  I wanted the toughest challenge for an 18 year old and I thought the and I knew that the Marine Corps would give it to me so I took it  are you happy  absolutely yes  yes now I was in Desert Storm  pretty easy to get used to growing my hair out again cuz I had it really short for 6 years and I really didn&#39;t like getting haircuts every week  other than that I went too soon as I got out I went to broadcasting school and everything pretty much went back to normal  I went to broadcasting school and then I I got a radio job in Palm Desert California and that was my first grader job but I don&#39;t know I work there for three months and I forgot a job in Riverside so after that I kept getting jobs and till now I&#39;ve worked in radio for 22 years  it changed me because I am more disciplined self this fund pay attention to detail more attention to detail than I ever have kind of a mental thing paying attention to detail but they drilled it into our heads  pretty plainly I like to keep  everything in its place and I like to keep ficked nobody taught me  in general been feeling really well I&#39;ve been exercising  four times a week either swimming or bike riding and or both so I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been feeling really well I can&#39;t complain  I know I&#39;ve always stated pretty even Keel and I like to like to keep it that way I don&#39;t like to get too low or get too high I like to stay stay even-keeled  it is pretty pretty easy when I work out a lot but there are sometimes when I I do if I&#39;m not a 5-mile bike ride and then I I I swim like 10 laps in the pool those days are easy for me to get a good night&#39;s sleep and some of the other days where I just do a bike ride or a swim but not both of those are pretty easy to sew  sometimes I have too much energy but the  but when I work out that energy yet I seem to have a good night sleep  what am I like when I don&#39;t sleep well well I get up and I am really groggy and tired and I have to have at least three cups of coffee and that usually gives me the energy that I need for the whole day  no I have never have  I recently had a checkup from the from the VA and everything was was perfect so I&#39;d I do not have PTSD  again I am at my last physical I was asked if I was feeling depressed and I told him no and they did tests and determined that I wasn&#39;t wasn&#39;t a depressed person so I never feel depressed I always feel you killed it and never feel depressed  the last time I felt really happy and well I&#39;m a big sports fan so whenever sports teams do well especially the Dodgers which they have been doing really well lately keeps me happy and I like to see my favorite teams do well because I feel on the part of the team because I attend the games and support the team and I like to do like to see them succeed so basically it&#39;s baseball season right now but football season is around the Home Run basketball teams in the hockey season so epic sports fans to one of my teams do album I am I am feeling really really good  somebody that&#39;s been a positive influence in my life I would say my parents they&#39;ve been married since 1955 so I&#39;m going up on almost 70 years 60 years 60 years so  I think my parents my mom is a big influence and she&#39;s a very good woman and taught us to be very good people so I would say my parents  my best friend describe me as determined  driven  and willing to succeed I would think  something I did recently in which I really enjoyed let&#39;s see  hide recently went  toys for game with my boss and it was a couple weeks ago and we had really good seats from from the team and we had a great night. The food we had hot dogs and and french fries and the and the Dodgers won in the bottom of the night so it was a really really good game and it was a good experience  most proud of being a marine serve six years in the Marine Corps around the Desert Storm veteran so Tuesday to the rank of Sergeant at the at 22 years old so I am grateful and most proud to be a United States Marine  thank you  we buy
427 and then I&#39;m going to go ahead and  how long do I talk to her more  okay  okay  yeah sure  I&#39;m good how are you  I&#39;m from Florida originally  where you from for work  I haven&#39;t been back in like a few months  I don&#39;t know I guess it&#39;s like a smaller town than here  it was pretty easy so it&#39;s not that much of a difference except my guess what buildings are bigger  I like the weather and I like the environment of like  Hollywood I guess  I hate the transportation transportation system and the traffic is really bad  yeah I traveled a lot around America  I like like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff and I guess it&#39;s just relaxing and it&#39;s fun  I went to Canada once my mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there it&#39;s pretty cold I didn&#39;t like that  about that particular trip or  I don&#39;t know if she meet us this like Canadian food cause I think it&#39;s poutine or something and so I guess that means I was a new experience  I tried to get out in the sun like go to the beach or something  I read a book  I&#39;m pretty okay  depends on how bad the situation is  I don&#39;t know like two days ago I was arguing with my sister about something  oh yeah I really don&#39;t remember it was something stupid I think she  she borrowed something from me and she didn&#39;t give it back on time  I don&#39;t know I guess maybe I wish I&#39;d just wouldn&#39;t lose my temper so quickly sometimes  but that doesn&#39;t happen really often  I don&#39;t know I guess think more before I talk and maybe I won&#39;t lose my temper  I wish I could erase your memory  I don&#39;t know I guess just  like God negative people or something or negative people that I&#39;ve met before I guess I just want to race the thought of meeting him  well I have like friends that we&#39;re just like not very good company and they&#39;re just very not very good influences so yeah I would just want to erase me even when I&#39;m not friends with him anymore  my  is it possible for my family so I wasn&#39;t  and my friends now  oh it&#39;s pretty good I talk to them like I see them a lot  so  hardest decision I&#39;ve had to make  I don&#39;t know  I guess  what I wanted to study in college Maybe  it&#39;s not that hard but it&#39;s a little it&#39;s a big decision  computer science  yeah a little bit not not as much but a little bit  well I got into it it when I got into it when I was a teenager so I guess I just and I was going to it so I just figured I&#39;d go on studying it hired at a higher level  yeah somewhat but I kind of wanted to be kind of try to make a decision between.

Enjoy the time of Europe I really liked it  could you repeat that again  why didn&#39;t further my education in college but I did finish high school and some of the subject that I liked and I was in high school was I love American history  and I enjoyed science stairs with some to a my top subjects when I was in high school  what do you do now  and now I work in real estate I work for a guy in real estate and I find property&#39;s or properties that has been abandoned by their owners or whoever that live there and if we can find the people we we we offered them a contract on the property then once they agree to that everybody signs off on it and then we start to go in and rehabitat the place fix it up clean it up and turn around and sell it at all and I put up Advertising Signs for the business also so I&#39;m evolve a little bit into real estate  I don&#39;t know if I have a dream job but  my success would lie on  being financially secure which I find  real estate can bring that once I start to achieve it so I guess my dream job would be to  how my own slower properties throughout California and possibly throughout some other states in our country and just doing very well in real estate  outgoing  because I&#39;m I&#39;m more open to people of different cultures I love to talk  I love to engage in intellectual conversations I like to debate I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m very open to any Topic in the subject that anyone want to speak about or speak on  so I consider myself very outgoing  my relationship with my family is very good my dad is deceased  I&#39;ve about  maybe 11 12 years now my mother is still alive she&#39;s live back in Georgia. Believe she&#39;s 75 years old now for social switch still resides in Georgia or brother that lives in outside Detroit  so that makes up my family I contact them on a weekly basis via email or text  or phone call or very close very close Southern family and I love them very much just don&#39;t get to see them as much as I like to  I&#39;m what I do to relax is to connect with on some close friends also I found out if I  going to work out or  do my thing is sort of really stressed I like to work out so a lot of times I go and take the dog for a walk or I&#39;ll watch a nice comedy on television so that&#39;s sort of how I get to  relieve the stress in my life  I&#39;m very easy I&#39;m I&#39;m very hard to get upset so it&#39;s nothing to control their but when I do feel like there is a temple coming on I sort of think about something else to do or  just Don allowed to control me  always think of something positive to do when I feel like my temper is starting to escalate  when was the  the last time I argue with someone was some  just last night my girlfriend where it was an argument but she felt like I wasn&#39;t giving her enough attention and I felt like I was giving her a lot of attention so neither one of us was willing to give an inch that&#39;s that&#39;s a trademark of aquarius so we sort of Argyll way to sleep  not a big argument but we just couldn&#39;t agree on what we wanted to get across to one another  I was basically about not enough time spent together  trying to think of a situation that I handled differently  sometimes feel guilty about is a divorced that  I did I went through about 7 years ago I should have thought it out  a lot more than I did before I made the decision I did so  I guess if that&#39;s the case I guess that would be something that I wish I could have done different  the hardest has not ever had to make was  agreeing to go into the military and I thought about it I didn&#39;t want to do it so it was a really hard decision because I knew once I had agreed to do it  to sign my name then I was obligated to go so that was a very hard decision  yes  I was 20  I believe I was 21 between 21 22 years old  I felt like actually going back to that first question I was about 19 years old when I joined the military I felt good about it  it was something I thought about doing and I wanted to do it I felt like it was  becoming of a man back then to join the military and I thought good about it and as I look at it today really kind of  set me up to the point that I&#39;m in my life now with the discipline and the structure of your life and your your family life so it really kind of  molded me into the person that I am at that I am now  are you having a good day  am I happy  yes  I went to the Gulf  I went to the Gulf War  in 1985 I spent six six months in a cup of Romaine in 1985 and that was a really  really tough experience right there for me  very hot very dangerous are in a hostile environment  I was really easy because after 4 years of serving in military I was I was done I was I was over it I was right to get back into civilian world and see what  the civilian world had to offer me  and so far as been good but I&#39;m glad at the same time I&#39;m glad I had that military experience you know that that military back and I have in my back pocket but I was ready for civilian life in  it&#39;s been great  author military I worked for  about 14 years as a security officer real nice job good pay unfortunate in 2005  my department was cut out due to the company not willing to negotiate our contract again so after 14 years of that I was let go  IAP made me more more rounded person it made me  see things a little different and civilian life it makes you a little bit stronger and make sure a little bit more discipline than the regular  and a gift your foundation  how to go about your business in civilian life is sort of  commit to me this major  better person all the way around how to accept things I have to accept different peoples in different cultures and it just makes you open up with your your thinking process  have you noticed any changes  I&#39;ve been feeling  and I&#39;m pretty good lately not as good as I want to feel but I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve been feeling okay  how easy is it for you to go  lately has been little bit hard because for some reason my neck have been tightening up on me so it&#39;s been a little bit difficult to get a good night sleep. Over the last couple weeks or so  that&#39;s been a lot going on  a little bit edgy little bit not attentive a little bit uneasy  those are some of the things that you know normally happens to me when I don&#39;t sleep well  no I haven&#39;t  I know I haven&#39;t  I guess I felt really happy  when I was able to move away from my mother-in-law&#39;s house and move into my own house which is about 4 years ago  and I made me really happy because me and my four kids and Kearney at that time my wife was all staying with  my mother-in-law and which we stay there for five years so I thought when we got our house I was so happy because I could do what I want to do I could move around as I wanted to in until  make me happy made my family happy also  I would say my mother course and my brother and my mother course because she&#39;s the one that brought me  and my brothers because I sort of see how he goes about his business and I sort of  sort of meaning  so I don&#39;t want to go down that same road as he&#39;s gone down and so those are my two  role models that she will call it  genuine  upbeat friendly positive  all the  something I did recent that I really enjoyed  nice  having my three kids  thank you  goodbye
333 okay alright  yes  very well  New York  this turn the volume up a little bit  4change that&#39;s good  I want it  wanted to see what Los Angeles was about  probably took a year to  not being away from my family being away from what I was used to in New York the neighborhood&#39;s the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here  all the weather  can&#39;t beat the weather generally always nice it&#39;s not too hot it&#39;s not too cold it&#39;s creative I do like in the movies  I like the beach  the traffic is a lot of traffic  some of it sometimes I think people are a little bit colder here then more distant and unfriendly than other places  I was a history major  no  I do I demonstrations in  a high end supermarkets  dog to be a screenwriter  that&#39;s one of the reasons why I came to Los Angeles  it&#39;s hard cuz I don&#39;t always maintain focus and motivation a lot of other things distract me  I was I&#39;ve always been interested in films ever since I was a child and I just always do know was rioting and had an active imagination  I&#39;ve been the last probably almost 10 years I&#39;ve traveled more than I had in the past while I&#39;ve always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around so yeah  seeing new places and seeing people that are different than I am seeing how they live  and taking in the sights  I went to Kenya that was probably one of the best trips ever went on on the Safari and  just going out in a Jeep and seeing wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible  oh yeah that&#39;s one of the great experiences of my life and I also got to a place in Egypt at the end of that trip called  Sharm El Sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that Egypt would but it was just amazing how I didn&#39;t go scuba diving I went snorkeling  what do I do to relax I do I like to listen to music I like to help and watching movies help me relax cuz it takes me out of you know whatever might be on my mind I do meditate everyday  I like to take walks and nature that&#39;s always calling especially down by the the ocean  depends sometimes I get angry and lose my temper a lot of times  I&#39;ll do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself which is something I&#39;ve recently learned how to do  this is very helpful  and also since I meditate it doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t get annoyed at things as easily as I did in the past  some things that make me really mad  I guess I think of Injustice  and the world are done to people when it doesn&#39;t really need to be that way that we could all get along  and to make the world better  out last night I went to a movie screening  how about independent film and I didn&#39;t think it was done very well. So much that we had a fun argument about a about the movie  so that was like now that this happened yesterday so that was that&#39;s on my mind  is there anything I regret the other there are have been opportunities in my life that I wished I had  taking them and pursue them  a certain jobs you know when I first got the Los Angeles I had an opportunity to  become a grip and I probably should have pursued that  how do I decide to do that I don&#39;t really understand the questions  take advantage of every opportunity that came my way that says always I think saying yes  any opportunity is is very important in the matter  how you feel you know you have to be confident that you&#39;ll be able to achieve what you want to do  now  now  no but I&#39;ve been depressed in my life  I&#39;ll for the most part of I&#39;ve been feeling good sometimes I feel a little blue I think sometimes I fight if I allow a  regret to come into my mind that can bring me down but I can you know you really get out of it pretty quickly  I&#39;ll sometimes Financial concerns sometimes  on an opportunity how do I explain it  the financials one way out that I had made another decision I might have more money or my life would be different  not really I mean I feel  pretty much the same  got me to sea kelp for  let&#39;s come back to that  well on his health when I did do that  stop pretty easy I don&#39;t have a problem sleeping  doodly I&#39;m grumpy  so if I don&#39;t sleep well you know I feel tired and irritable  how would my best friend describe me  good question of why I&#39;m definitely friendly and outgoing little bit secretive  probably that I should be there like to see me more accomplished and detaining my goals and it may be a little happier  I think  it&#39;s tough at the pants sometimes I&#39;m very introverted cuz I do like to write so that takes means that I have to spend time alone and then when I come out of that I&#39;m extroverted so I don&#39;t really see myself as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation in my mood  my best qualities I think I&#39;m caring I think I&#39;m intelligent  I think I&#39;m funny I&#39;m out going I have a likeable personality and people have said that I&#39;m engaging but not oppressive or overly engaging there&#39;s a set of a cool detachment  in Creative intuitive  yes  last time I felt really happy  I&#39;ll I woke up this morning I was pretty happy  at breakfast I was happy  Sun was shining  I think like I said going to Kenya  what&#39;s up memorable experience scuba snorkeling was a really great experience I just remembered you know seeing all the colors in the ocean and out and feeling the sun powerful sun on my back  almost beyond beyond like  2 minute away this warrant touch with like everything in the universe  that would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but  what am I most proud of in my life  I think I&#39;ve  helped  people  and sometimes when they were in crisis  in our Britain some screenplays  Pat some good relationships  good relationships just being connected with someone else you know  spending time with them and connecting  unemotional  physical and  metal levels  could be a song that I hear on the radio it could be a lot of times looking forward to something you know if I&#39;m going to go to a movie go bowling hang out with people  you&#39;re not looking at work and then going to work and feeling productive and put me and puts me in a good mood  you&#39;re welcome bye bye  like that like what do you remember what  okay will you depressed and I was like  explain that and then it was like I did something and then it was like well bridge to that, got it got it

448 okay great thank you yes  doing pretty good  all I was born in Brooklyn New York I came out here when I was seven and I&#39;ve been here ever since I don&#39;t consider myself anything but Oak California  I&#39;m a welder  I just I don&#39;t know it was something about making and Building Things and repairing things that intrigue me and I was actually pretty good at it so I stuck with it and and that&#39;s my profession  T I really never had that I&#39;ve just kind of always hope that I would have a job that could support myself and my family and I was satisfied with that  well I just recently lost my uncle and he raised me since I was 7 years old and other than my wife I don&#39;t have any more family he passed away last July and  starting to get over it I knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so  I&#39;ve been depressed about that and I&#39;ll but I&#39;m doing better  it depends on the atmosphere if I&#39;m around people that I don&#39;t feel comfortable with kind of reserved but if I&#39;m comfortable and I feel like I fit in I&#39;m not going  screensaver  right  I enjoy old movies old while it&#39;s called film Noir and I love those old black-and-white movies and I get on Netflix or Amazon and I try to pick a movie that from back then people were different than day I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just a different era and I enjoy it  my wife says I probably is not as good as I think I do but I&#39;ve got to admit sometimes I lose my temper and it is according to her over things that I shouldn&#39;t be losing my temper about but I&#39;m working on it and I have basically had this problem ever since I was young child  oh yes  I&#39;ve been in and out of trouble with the law when I was much younger I&#39;m past that point now but you know when you&#39;re young you think you know everything and you know you never going to get old and the future doesn&#39;t matter but it does matter because everything that you do when you&#39;re young follows you for the rest of your life and  I don&#39;t regret things that I&#39;ve done but if I could go back I definitely would make different choices  me and my wife we we don&#39;t argue we disagree and it&#39;s she&#39;s very strong-willed and she&#39;s a match for me so we go back and forth but we don&#39;t get violent and we don&#39;t say meaningful things or hurt each other we&#39;re just she is a determined strong-willed woman and I am who I am so we kind of go back and forth and  lately I have been the one to bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because in the long run it&#39;s just her and me and there&#39;s nobody else more important to me  when I was younger I wish that I didn&#39;t follow some of the people that I followed and what I mean by that is no running in a circle with a certain people I am having an ego bigger than my common sense and that&#39;s what got me into trouble I was an only child and  I kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and  getting the girls to laugh or having people think I was going to cool or whatever you wouldn&#39;t think that now I&#39;m kind of overweight involving but when I was in my twenties I was at a completely different person and  if I would have had some brothers and sisters I may not have thought or acted that way but I was an only child so  I  you know where and we&#39;re  people thought I was cool and that got me into trouble  tell me about the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to  hardest decision I ever had to make was  giving the authorization to  have my uncle passed away he was on life support and his kidneys have failed and  doctor said there&#39;s nothing more I could do and to not have him go through any suffering  to let him slip away  Michigan see I get very upset my uncle  raised me like his own son and  never let me down  and he&#39;s gone and  for lack of a better word to push the button I never thought I would have to do that  but as I said I&#39;m getting over it and  things are getting better slowly  my wife she is always there for me she will always surprise me we she&#39;s not my wife she&#39;s my best friend and she knows me better than I know myself we enjoy doing simple things it&#39;s not that we can&#39;t do other things if we wanted to but we mesh we enjoy each other&#39;s company we like the same things and we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we we just enjoy each other&#39;s company and she like I say knows me better than anybody in the enzyme it surprised me sometimes  how is your day  you know lately when I can&#39;t say lately if I don&#39;t excuse me if I don&#39;t do  a rigorous activity or something that really stresses me or strained my body at let&#39;s say for a couple of days I&#39;m just very relaxed and not doing much  I just automatically get up after 4 and 1/2 5 hours I mean En Mi y physician now that you&#39;re not getting any sleep but I mean I don&#39;t feel tired I don&#39;t feel so exhausted I don&#39;t feel like I need to go back to sleep I&#39;ll stay up all day and I&#39;m fine and most people will say that&#39;s not enough sleep but you know for me it doesn&#39;t affect me  well it was some things could be different but I&#39;m not dissatisfied I&#39;m happy with my life that they&#39;re like with anybody else there&#39;s a few things that I wish would different and I think that&#39;s an anybody everybody else has no life but I&#39;m content  yeah I feel a little less motivated  recently well I can&#39;t say recently this was back in January  my wife and a few friends were noticing that I was becoming forgetful and I couldn&#39;t remember things I didn&#39;t see it and you know when they wouldn&#39;t everybody brought it to my attention then I started to anyway I went to the doctor and they gave me the test and apparently I have MCI which is mild cognitive impairment and I&#39;ve over the last month or so  nobody has mentioned it to me I&#39;m a man maybe I&#39;m getting better but the neurologist that I saw us as having me come back in a year and going to retest me hopefully it&#39;s not the beginning stages of Alzheimer&#39;s I&#39;m still a little young for that I&#39;m away from 52 but I was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and it could have been due also I was told by him because of the death of my uncle I could have been very depressed and I was not able to retain things and  tell work I&#39;m going back in a year and we&#39;ll see if I&#39;m any better  I&#39;m sorry  I&#39;m not understanding you I&#39;m sorry  no no I have not  yes  2001  I was in a what is the word I&#39;m looking for I was in a  in a state of mind of where I was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if I didn&#39;t seek any help I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder Waring and thinking too much about things and thinking the worst and  I I take medication for that  well you know it&#39;s not really therapy it&#39;s you know every few months you know you got to see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription it&#39;s in alphabet you know kind of like the next person next person that is I am with Kaiser so it sits they&#39;ll talk to you but it did they give you the impression that  you know I okay let&#39;s move along you know that they&#39;ll hear your explanation but you know they don&#39;t have all the time for you that you may want so I&#39;m doing fine now if I really needed help I would I would do something the medication works for me  last time I felt real happy  well it would depend on what the event is I&#39;m always happy when I&#39;m doing something with me and my wife and we&#39;re enjoying each other and I ain&#39;t no I&#39;m not trying to sound like she&#39;s my whole world and I don&#39;t have anything else she is my world but I enjoy being with her and we we we do things together and I&#39;m happy all the time when when we&#39;re doing that when I&#39;m outside of that Circle  I don&#39;t know if the sounds right but I&#39;m not seeking happiness I I can only explain it as I&#39;m content I&#39;m not  I&#39;m not disappointed or I&#39;m not wanting anything I&#39;m being whatever comes my way is fine so  well  I don&#39;t know why I couldn&#39;t give you that answer I want my best friend is my wife but she would describe me is I don&#39;t think before I speak I let the littlest insignificant things bother me and I get angry over but the big things it&#39;s like I let it go and she&#39;s bewildered by that  years and years ago she had a classic Pontiac LeMans and she had got into a minor fender-bender and she thought it was going to be the end of the world cuz that was my baby and I don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll get it fixed and she what she thought was going to hang or something this was as you know it was my baby and she calls you know you you get excited over nothing but you know I ate something like wrecking your car that you love and he put so many hours of work into it money  it all gets crashed and it&#39;s like you don&#39;t care so  that&#39;s the only way I can explain it  well I need to lose some weight if you could say I&#39;m definitely been on the eating beans and the neurologist said that&#39;s probably due to the event with my uncle I&#39;m here I am this is the heaviest ever been in my life and I&#39;m finding it a little bit harder I can&#39;t say harder but I&#39;m finding the willpower  just say no and stick with it and to go exercise or not you no movement now Gourmet before walking on me and my wife and we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks and we lived in a  hey boy you don&#39;t look at that wonder what&#39;s inside their ER at that&#39;s the way that we don&#39;t do that no more I guess it&#39;s worth a little bit older now and  trouble heavy retarded to walk with all this weight but I I I wish I could change that because  this is not a healthy size  lately  no I don&#39;t regret anything lately everything&#39;s been fine the I could say that the biggest  biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and I never ever  in a hundred years there ever thought that I would face that situation and I&#39;ll never forget it but  they say time heals all wounds and and it does  don&#39;t listen to other people  again I&#39;m not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to he would see the things that I was doing in the pads that I was going down and I constantly thought I knew better and I think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they the young lady that I was talking to in here they think they&#39;re invincible and so did I I figured I&#39;d never going to God I&#39;m never going to have those problems I wish I could have changed some things the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me and in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that I&#39;m able to do I don&#39;t miss them but if I could go back 10 or 20 years I definitely wouldn&#39;t make some of the decisions I made  my welding certificates I&#39;m certified by the American Welding Society and I have that&#39;s probably the biggest achievement that I made for you know myself an accomplishment  people that I know say that I&#39;m well I haven&#39;t been working on cars lately but they said that I have a natural knack for restoration and working on vehicles and I don&#39;t see it but I&#39;ve been told that once or twice but I I&#39;ve kind of  I&#39;ve kind of started to slip away from that I don&#39;t know why I can&#39;t say from lack of interest but I just don&#39;t feel the motivation no more I wish I had a pocket of money and I have somebody else to it that&#39;s how I feel  okay well thank you  bye-bye  hey  okay well I&#39;ll tell you know after a couple of minutes
423 okay and please  yes  feeling well  where are you from originally Los Angeles the Greater Los Angeles area  people  diversity and  various entertainment and activities  fickle weather  traffic and

San Diego  butt out  from childhood or as an adult  family vacations to Baja in Rosarito Beach  can you tell me  yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because this weekend is Easter and we usually will go down to East Easter spring break to Rosarito Baja  am I have a Bachelors in communication studies  because of the open field just doesn&#39;t deal with them communication interactively but Performing Arts telecommunications business entrepreneurship so  no I&#39;m not at Maxey unemployed  what&#39;s your dream job  I think 200 my business that&#39;s my dream my dream job to have my own company  I would like to open something like the Telecommunications area  as a business something do online online services I like to make things with my hands so my next venture with would be to create all-natural soy candles  something in that area  a mixture  mixture of shy and outgoing because I have to observe people in crowds and that&#39;s how I usually make a determination if I remain reserved remain open  I listen to like a meditation tape or I take a walk or go get a massage  Fair  oh man I probably yesterday or this morning usually the argument is about me making myself clear Army repeating myself twice  no usually gets the other person in trouble  tell me about a situation that you wish you would have  I redeemed a service from a mechanic who fix my transmission and I had a warranty and I wrote to the Department of Consumer Affairs and the guy offered me a portion of the settlement agreement and I decided to take him to small claims court to get a bigger amount and I wish I would have have  taking the offer that he gave me at the midst of dealing with a third party which was the Department of Consumer Affairs and because of that I took him to small claims court and I end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion so I wish I would have taken the higher road to taking a lower Road  I don&#39;t tend to feel guilty about too many things  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to make  hardest decision  I don&#39;t know financially emotionally  emotionally letting go of past relationship the hardest thing to say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing  can you tell me about  yes it was a relationship of 7 years but that person is already moved on  so they want me to be in their life and hopes that if something goes wrong with my current relationship will always have something to fall back on  that sounds really hard  oh yeah it is hard  tell me about your bag or something that you wish you could erase from your  in advance  so that I can trace for my memory  I don&#39;t know there&#39;s a lot of events that I just automatically erased from my memory but whatever comes to mind right  probably the death of a relative  I&#39;m alone and misinformed  because I didn&#39;t know that they were that sick and I didn&#39;t know that they were their days were numbered  and I could have had more opportunity to spend time with them and make better a better connection in the last days  I&#39;m sorry to hear that  tell me about your relationship with you  is Fair to Midland  are you into your family  my immediate I&#39;m very close but distant not very close  okay  my mother  tell me about  and yes I she&#39;s encouraged me to continue my education to always fall back on my hobbies hopes golden dreams she always encourages me to always stay loose and out there looking for a better opportunity  and she encourages me to not be afraid to explore other Ventures  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  easy  I&#39;ve been feeling well  yes a little stressed but I&#39;m trying to manage that  I leave the stressful environment  in the past  about 3 years ago  because I was having issues in my learning environment  and I was feeling emotionally attached  yeah I was having an issue with a professor who was just very  I know you have a very different personality  he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school  how do you feel  I felt I felt like I was in a dishonest environment I felt  like I wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class but I had no choice but to stay in there and deal with his meanness for the whole semester  have you been diagnosed with depression  I think through finding PTSD they were trying to link depression  you still go to therapy now no  financially  I&#39;m not capable and I haven&#39;t found a counselor who&#39;s willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues  I find a lot of counselors they listen to me and then they laugh at me and then they tell me the opposite of what&#39;s what I&#39;m telling them  last time I felt really happy I really don&#39;t know that&#39;s a good question  something you did recently that you really enjoy  just just do what I want I just relaxed  I just relaxed and  you know I don&#39;t know  I don&#39;t have any best friends  my best qualities that I&#39;m hard-working I&#39;m reliable I&#39;m an excellent friend  I&#39;m energetic  and I&#39;m going to go get her  things that I wish I could change about myself probably be less sensitive  don&#39;t take things so personally  and  learn how to help myself before helping others  no I don&#39;t have any regrets in my life  if I could do things differently 10 years ago I probably would have  focus and study more  and less  being out of the house and hanging with friends  what are you most proud of in your life  baguette have a college education and I&#39;m self-sufficient  and  I can pay my bills by myself and  I&#39;m alive  goodbye  hi  so then where you at that was exactly
708 Minister for camcorder recording when I reach the human from  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  are you okay with this sure glad  okay  so how are you doing today  I&#39;m good Ellie how are you  I&#39;m Pasadena  hi the weather I love the weather I love the people there so many things to do in LA I love La you know it&#39;s my home and I wouldn&#39;t live anywhere else  traffic the traffic that&#39;s probably the biggest thing is getting a little crowded  that&#39;s it  when I was in the military at job with a lot I haven&#39;t traveled too much in the past few years but I&#39;m looking forward to doing some more traveling soon  what do you enjoy about  eating eating new foods eating different type of foods depending on where I go maybe the nightlife clubs and stuff like that  and just going somewhere new you know cuz culturally I appreciate differences so  I&#39;d like to hear about what  one of my trips Japan you know when I got to Japan only stayed for 6 months but  you start to learn more about yourself I learn more about myself as an American by going overseas and understanding that  just because I&#39;m American and I&#39;m from this country this is not the only country in the world in millions of people billions of people actually live a lot different from my dude from we do and just learning to appreciate the differences you know  and appreciate myself to  but the trip itself you know actually 6 months is not long enough I think where you go to a foreign country for me because at the six-month Point that&#39;s exactly when I started to I really wanted to just wanted to stay but it was time to come back so then again like I said traveling food Customs just learning more about other cultures and it&#39;s real exciting this it&#39;s it&#39;s not to mention educational but  I think it&#39;s needed I think a lot of Americans are a lot of my family members would never been able to go out of the country need a trip somewhere you know I don&#39;t know if America to really understand their place in the world  I will probably actually flying to Japan in flying over Alaska the mountain tops in Alaska I need the mountain ranges are so huge and they were all covered with snow but it look like we were close enough to actually put our hands out of the plane and touch the top of us you know snow capped mountains I thought that was really exciting  what you study at school I was a criminal justice major  now I work in the medical field actually  dream job and actors being an actor that would be a dream job  I&#39;ll going  tell me about your relationship with your family  well I have one brother and two sisters I&#39;m close to my younger sister she just had the first grandchild in the group of my siblings you know a couple of years ago so I haven&#39;t had a few she lives in Oregon my other sister lives here in the LA area my brother lives in Oakland I would like to visit I would like for us to all be together you know more than we are but we&#39;re not so we do the best we can but the relationship is pretty strong my mom she lives down in San Diego and I try to talk to her at least once a week and get to go down and see her every every now and then my father passed away in 04  and for the extended family will usually get together on holidays Manny Thanksgiving Christmas and keep in contact like everybody else now on Facebook  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling  I turn on  I&#39;ll go to the gym go to the gym or maybe you know sometimes now as I&#39;m getting older I realize when I take a nap that kind of helps me to relax wake up refreshed and ready to go  how are you in control  I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my temper you know like everyone else I have I&#39;ve got pet peeves and if it&#39;s one of the peeves that might tend to get a little angrier than some of the other things that you note in the bother me but overall I control my ankle pretty well  when was the  the last argument  wow I don&#39;t remember  situation that I would have handled differently  I&#39;ve seen I had a laptop and that I was over a acquaintance home and my laptop disappeared  and I didn&#39;t get angrier and you know I didn&#39;t I was just really too, nonchalant about the whole incident and as I look back on it I should have probably be and should have been more assertive about them finding my laptop for you know finding out what happened and I kind of just let that go and  didn&#39;t say much  that&#39;s something you feel guilty about  I feel guilty about not working out  as often as I see it  the hardest decision I ever had to make  I haven&#39;t had any hard decisions I&#39;m hard decisions  staying in LA and not moving back to Philadelphia that was a hard decision you know I lived in Philadelphia for a couple years and I moved back home but I wanted to move back but I did and I stayed here you know that was a hard decision  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from  probably the abuse my father exhibited towards my mother as a child  yes  18  by the members of my family has been in the military and I don&#39;t think I was ready for college at that point so I actually sign the papers when I was 17 for the delayed entry program and winning after graduation  are you happy  yes extremely  did you ever see cow  no combat no  how easy was it for you  made the transition was  more difficult than I anticipated it was strange even though I had been in the military for those years and I had really become a different type of person and it took a little while but it happens they have a thing called separation for about the last two months before you&#39;re discharged where I kind of helps you get ready or prepared you back to get into civilian life so it takes a little while but it&#39;s it&#39;s it it happens it takes a while some people takes longer you know some people didn&#39;t take us long so  I went to school  how did serving in the military change you  it allowed me to mature I don&#39;t think I&#39;m I don&#39;t know if I would have gotten that when I went to college right after high school or not but it allow me to also be on my own and kind of find out who I was and grow up so  how have you been feeling lately been feeling great you know I I don&#39;t have any worries or complaints  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or thoughts lately no  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep pretty easy I&#39;m a light sleeper but I sleep pretty well  what are you  grumpy  irritated easily not too Pleasant to be around  have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD no  yes  when was the last time  really happy well probably last week last Wednesday  my father  well I mean I think one of the things I got from my father was to always be positive and it in and the level determination is basically never give up on what you want to do  how do your best friend  as a good friend funny  caring giving  what&#39;s something you did  volunteering for a charity helping serve food to other individuals  nice  what are you most proud of  my track and field trophies  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you  stop the recording and you can give me
627 I am so I&#39;m going to bring up the Virginia 1%  and then bring it back down to Thursday  so you&#39;re going to see  it can only end  ask questions you can answer Ray  and you respond like she should say goodbye but it&#39;s right and reason she stopped  glitch glitch  like a computer glitch or something  okay  yep yes  okay  pretty good pretty good I had a good morning a good productive day did some work with the some kids at a basketball camp so  New York  well  what I like about  what do I know about traveling  meeting new people kind of having that experience of  being in the moment all the time because everything is so new  and  just kind of getting my  my routine shaken up a little bit temporarily  my trips are probably  that&#39;s one baby was when I went to Costa Rica  if I got like seven or eight other friends and then  four of us went on to go to Guatemala and I&#39;m sorry  Panama to an island off Panama and You&#39;re Just Amazing Just total New World new totally new cultures off the beaten path it was nothing I never seen before so  open up my eyes to  the world lolbit  probably  I studied  theater and politics and music  right now I am deciding or figuring out if I&#39;m going to be  doing basketball as a career or if I&#39;m going to be doing it networking type stuff as a career  kind of depends probably  probably 65% sure I&#39;m 35% alcohol  I  and I think I just like to kind of take  take things slow and get to know someone a little bit first before I open up to them but sometimes I&#39;m just in a real gregarious mood it just kind of floats out of me and I&#39;m just like talking everyone but usually I kind of hang back a little bit and  get a feel for the person before I open up to them  all meditate now it&#39;s been so helpful  play Hoops I write a. Journal  and I talked to someone that and I care about let him know that I love him  probably too good  I think I keep  things inside maybe sometimes I&#39;m free pretty patient I kind of  put it all on my shoulders and  well ya know once or twice  things built up and I didn&#39;t Express them  so it eventually led to like erratic Behavior because it kind of came out in like spurts are like bursts  and a bunch of stuff is like Unleashed it once  instead of you know normally something happens it gets released when this case  something got released it was like a hundred things got released at 1 cuz it all been saved up  the last time I argue with someone  probably with  when I  broke up with my girlfriend before I  was  deployed overseas  yeah I didn&#39;t  back the way I handle that  I kind of just laughed and pretending not to care anymore  she didn&#39;t deserve that her family didn&#39;t deserve that  it&#39;s been pretty good to me  starcycle erase  yes  18  because I am I want to serve my country I was born in New York and New York was hit the timer 11th and I was 17  and I  do I want to go to college so why not  termite country  yes all in all yes it was tough it was tough but  and you are  I needed to get that dose of reality  kind of a pretty drastic change from make a wish there had been more of a gradual increase in the intensity of experience  I got a little overwhelmed at times but  Made Me Stronger in the end  yes  Acme  you know that&#39;s a lie like a few maybe 5 or 7 years to completely kind of a simile my experience but only like me in the first 6 months after  I got out of the army was a little strained I kind of just  did nothing cuz I don&#39;t even so structure for so long and I was just like  I&#39;m living on my own schedule not doing anything yeah and then  you know I was coming sometime after that just to kind of figure out what I wanted to do in life  I went back to school or went went went to college for the first time started playing basketball game for college and  if we kept that up last couple years I just started  coaching basketball in  doing some computer training learning networks do networking  and it&#39;s right now I&#39;m right now I&#39;m writing a book on  what I&#39;ve learned  Aurora  really good really  really free like I&#39;m creating my own future now for the first time  and a long long time  yeah yeah  it&#39;s been a little bit  what&#39;s the word like I knew on the edge  no not not like  since  I&#39;m the biggest thing I change my behavior was signed to meditate  for sure so did that for the first time by 3 years ago  and  that  the pretty much brought me back to myself I kind of like you know what I consider to be like my true self  so that doesn&#39;t change my behavior has now I&#39;m acting more from  my heart instead of like reacting to like my thoughts about to pass the future  nine times Outta ten  Ashley pretty great  when I don&#39;t sleep well it&#39;s pretty clear I&#39;m pretty I&#39;m pretty quiet I kind of keep to myself  I don&#39;t have that like sparkle I don&#39;t have that like  valakut attack energy know that energy to go out and get go out and get it right now  little bit tired didn&#39;t sleep that great last night  so they went to bed late and I&#39;m going to go to bed like 9:10 last night I went to bed at like 1 and I&#39;m helping a friend move  so yeah today I&#39;m feeling I&#39;m a little bit like black  no  not really  no I never been diagnosed I went to a. Where  you know the first two or three years after I was in the Army and I kind of wanted life to be the way it was before I joined the army things I think there wasn&#39;t a lot simpler than to me and a lot more manageable and then I got hurt while playing basketball  and you know so I couldn&#39;t like play Hoops for a while for like 2 years and I&#39;d say like I was pretty. I was pretty down during that.  But  I was thinking as I was always  I had one foot in the down the down Zone but my other foot was in like how do I get myself out of this predicament I never liked gave up hope  flashes like fossil flash like  every everyone long once in awhile recite what&#39;s the point you know like and then just died at the end anyways so why so why fight you know why struggle  but  in general live 99.999% of the time  got it got it just going to go deep inside and find out what the right thing to do is and then do it the best I can  well I was I mean  I was pretty happy last night when I saw my girlfriend and I got to like spend quality time with her and just kind of like give her love and like not make it all about swing physical and I was pretty happy when I first got into La so we could go and I made it to Venice and I was playing hoops and sunny as beautiful and I was free at my car  hey No Agenda at Money in the Bank  probably  I know by when I went on that trip to  well  person Moments 2 years ago me and my brother and my sister went on a trip together Dominican Republic  that was awesome  definitely definitely of the girl that was my  my first love like she was a great person  to really really good heart  and  I kind of  my best friend probably thinks that like you know I&#39;m  Miss like funny cool guy  that&#39;s like going to be a movie star someday or something  they take everyone on like trips in like  just like make everything fun for everyone else  playing basketball in Venice Beach  smite  to my it&#39;s either my phone or I may just be the first to tie for first  place to pay to play basketball in the hole that I ever played  and now is  play yesterday against a bunch of guys  and it was just great it was just magical it&#39;s I love I love to be I love the people I love the the craziness that comes through their people on bikes with boom boxes be inclined to the people freaking just stuff in the background on the boardwalk  you know running around make things interesting  and I&#39;m playing basketball I missed all of that and just  that&#39;s great
337 virtuous are you okay  yeah  I&#39;m doing okay how are you doing  I&#39;m originally from like a suburb of LA from the San Gabriel Valley  I like the diversity I like the vibe of the city I&#39;ve lived other places and just not  as happy here I feel like I can really Thrive here so I just like la like all the things that are so close together and there&#39;s a lot of interesting things are totally different parts of the city 2 miles away from each other  don&#39;t like the traffic. Like all the cars but I can live with it I mean there&#39;s not that much I don&#39;t like  aesthetic music vocal performance the study music technology things like that  yes  right now I sing an opera company but my I do have a day job because it doesn&#39;t pay that much unless you&#39;re actually working for the LA Opera so I do have a day job and work at a call center that caters mostly to performers and actors and things like that and it&#39;s really good because if I get a call I can call in and change my shift very easily actually pretty good gig  they do some technology gigs sometimes yes you do some recording some live sound stuff but I&#39;m kind of want to get away from that do some video work sometimes but again I want to get away from that don&#39;t go back to the because I find that performing more is more interesting I like being Talent where they like being crew  so I kind of want to get away from that side and start working more toward actually doing what I want to do with my life  okay  you consider yourself  sometimes mean repair my personal life yeah they do have a shell that I put out there to deal with people but if I&#39;m at home rather just keep to myself or my husband or my cats or whatever talk to family don&#39;t really have too many close friends but yeah you know  I rather keep to myself  a moderately close to the family that I have laughed have actually lost a lot of family in the last 10 years or so but like thank you but like my gym clothes to my husband and and  I&#39;ve got a couple of cousin I talk to you and my aunt that I have an aunt that I talk to you a bit but it&#39;s not like we&#39;re interacting everyday close together  but it&#39;s somewhat close  mostly I saying or I read or write or  hang out and try to clear my mind of all thoughts sometimes it doesn&#39;t work but they try to do that and try to  clear everything and see what starts coming back in and  sometimes a heart sometimes that doesn&#39;t but mostly creating things contacting my family through Facebook or whatever works but  most of my free time I create things  I like to travel more I travel by car a lot new my idea of  like having a birthday celebration would be to go on a road trip and I like to travel more  I&#39;d like to travel for work things or whatever but I don&#39;t get as much an opportunity as I would like to travel  sea of particulate driving my car seem like the landscape change seeing people change seeing you feeling the vibrations of the area change like just seeing what&#39;s out there and I know that there&#39;s a bigger World outside of  where I am and where I live in my world and like to see that  but I like to leave that to go back to my world  a trip I&#39;d like to take us to make the drive from here to Nevada weather I go all the way to Vegas or just go to Stateline  my cousin and I would take what we call exit one trip because once you get to the first exit of a highway you&#39;re either in another state or you&#39;re at the end of the highway so would take those we just sort of impromptu would like a day or two notice just move things around just take off so those are actually trips that I like make could take off and then just come back sometimes the same day sometimes overnight just small short trips that aren&#39;t very involved but you just get to go and you see things and see how the desert landscape looks in different seasons how people react in different times of the year in different areas  too close to home but not  but not close to home close to home but it was still a world away so that cuz I don&#39;t really have time to take like a two-week vacation or whatever little things that kind of put things back in perspective and clear my head think like that mean cuz there&#39;s sort of a sense of meditation and then that you get on a highway that you can get driving the freeway so I like doing that  the last time that happened was May of last year so I might be able to do that we actually my aunt came over with my cousin who is 10 years younger than I am and we kind of grew up like sisters and I was about to move away from the Inland Empire which is where they live so kind of took me on a last hurrah when we drove up to Vegas and looked around and came back cuz I actually lived in Vegas for a while but I don&#39;t like it so it&#39;s kind of a social to some of the locals sites around there and we came back and was an overnight trip but we are driving the entire time  it&#39;s kind of interesting  things are just inherently unfair when people are mean to the elderly or two children or the animals people who can&#39;t fight back and I mean to them just because they can&#39;t fight back  and  actually  like to see people who are  as strong as the people who are being mean standing up and being an advocate or what have you  so I think that&#39;s one thing this makes me really mad just being cruel or mean for no reason and I&#39;m not good for people who can&#39;t fight back a few people who&#39;ve done nothing to deserve it  that kind of really just makes me mad  okay  but I&#39;m annoyed I&#39;ll try to just walk away from the situation and if the situations to start following me then I&#39;ll wind up lashing out somehow either  are verbally just  cutting them with a quipper you know really just I really will yell at somebody  but I&#39;ll try to if I try to walk away and diffuse it if that doesn&#39;t work they don&#39;t let them know that they&#39;re annoying me and get away from me  not like legal trouble or anything because usually I&#39;ll find a way to get them to leave me alone  there&#39;s not really like big trouble but cuz it cuz it&#39;s it is off-putting and it&#39;s not an expected reaction and that&#39;s actually kind of cultivated in me that it&#39;s not the expected reactions I know that will work and get people away from me so it&#39;s not really in trouble and if it&#39;s is trouble issues of trouble that is from mad that other person&#39;s perspective and doesn&#39;t affect me at all because do the situation I can get out of  so as long as they leave me alone and walk away from it  the last time I argued with somebody  Hurt Like a Prayer like a family member or an outsider or somebody not  the last thing I could think of was  a argued with my husband about the care of my mother-in-law cuz she&#39;s got dementia and so we were the reason we came out here from the Inland Empire with take care of her she won&#39;t go anywhere but LA and she is like hardcore Angelino like we know we are that wear that in our nature but we also know it&#39;s cheaper to live elsewhere but so we came out here to take care of her  and he wants her to be able to stay in her in her apartment and I want her to move in with us because it would be cheaper and faster and easier and safer for her if she lived with us but she wants to stay where she is cuz she can&#39;t see that there&#39;s inherent danger now because of the disease process but he wants her to stay where she he wants her to be able to have what you want cuz he&#39;s a mama&#39;s boy like I am I&#39;m a mama&#39;s girl you know I lost my mom like four years ago I&#39;m still a mama&#39;s girl and I&#39;ll standing still and I know that it brings you a sense of satisfaction to carry out their wishes because you care about them so much that&#39;s what they wants you want to get it for him and because you don&#39;t they you know that happened when you were going up with me try to give you what you want because you wanted it and you want to do that for them now they started giving back to them somebody that you care about me you feel deserves it  but it&#39;s kind of dangerous for you know I don&#39;t want this thing to happen to her yet I want her to remain who she is for as long as you can so I know it seems that she has is going to erase who she is eventually and eventually she will have to be put in a place where they can give a 24-hour medically trained care but until then we can we can handle it you know amongst ourselves it&#39;s not that bad but it&#39;s getting where she really should has no business living by herself anymore so the solution right now is he stays there most of time with her and I go back to our house and it gets stressful and it gets annoying because it&#39;s I do I handle the outside things are run the errand to take her to the store things like that he does the day-to-day things make sure she has she eats make sure she has clean clothes things like that  so me it&#39;s a partnership it to its  a dual effort is very much to do effort but I would like her to move in with us so that was that&#39;s like  a source of not really like yelling screaming argument but Lively discussion and debate  not insurmountable mean life&#39;s not going to be easy ever and if it is at when you should worry because that&#39;s when somebody can pull the rug out from under you so as long as you&#39;re on top of things in your present your life is not going to be easy you deal with it and move on  the most positive influence to think I&#39;ve been probably my mother and my grandmother cuz my mom was pretty much a single mom and my grandmother helped raise me and they actually  gave me a lot of confidence and but we&#39;re realistic about it  I mean I think I have sort of a  realistic serve a downer temperament to myself that they that they helped me see that it&#39;s just in me and it&#39;s not something I can&#39;t get over and that you know life&#39;s going to go on and my mom would say to me when you&#39;re forty or fourty whether you working at McDonald&#39;s or doing what you want with your life I think that was a big influence and how it with I was like my life since she has passed  I regret not taking care of myself in the last year my mother&#39;s life because I think I may have clouded some of my decisions know it do have underlying conditions everyone in my family is diabetic I didn&#39;t take care of that when she was the last year for life because I was too busy wanting to get her home my focus was to get her home so I didn&#39;t eat ride I didn&#39;t take my insulin right on my wanted making myself insulin resistant that that you&#39;re just because my blood sugar was so high for a like a year eating just horrible Foods when I did eat so it really took it really actually made myself very sick and I&#39;m wondering well if I didn&#39;t if I would have taken care of myself and I had my head on completely straighten my my vision in my thoughts weren&#39;t complete run clouded  what I made some better decisions on her behalf especially when she needed them when she needed me to be to step in and make this is for because she wound up having a health catastrophe she had kidney we said can you damage I want to be kidney failure and her health insurance provider miss that so she wanted having sort of this hole  catastrophe where everything at once just started breaking down she wanted having a stroke at like 51 small stroke and it just kind of went down from there something while if I didn&#39;t if I had taken care of better care of myself but I&#39;ve been able to take better care of her  I know there wasn&#39;t anything I would have been able to do to prevent her death what I say if I what I&#39;ve been able to make it easier on her  if I would have taken care of myself that&#39;s like one huge regret that I have  oh I know I am but it&#39;s my desire to take responsibility for everyone and everything that I care about taking responsibility for my own life and me and mine and I know other people I can&#39;t really direct them into my own Vision because they&#39;re their own  individual beings  and they can&#39;t you know be what I want them to be and I know they&#39;re not going to be  but I still have you know my ideals and I want the way I want everything to go and I want everybody that I care about to be happy and to be able to  fit into my life in a way in the best way possible but I know there are other beings and I&#39;m not going to be able to do that for them then I can build you up for me but it still buy ideals so I have to sometimes have to look at it going well is this what I want because I want it or what is what they want and what&#39;s their is their decision or mine and she&#39;s it&#39;s theirs I know it&#39;s there so if you really care about somebody you&#39;re just going to support them and go with them but  it still  kind of hard for me and I know I got to get over it  10 or 20 years ago  probably to have been more assertive and starting my own life because I want up taking care of my mother mean she got sick literally the weekend I graduated from college and had a job lined up and had to pull out of that because she needed me to take care of her I think would have been more aggressive about starting my own life getting a job outside the house in addition to caring for her getting my own job history of my own credit history thing like to think like that built up instead of becoming just totally her daughter for about 10 years  so I figured I probably would have done that  Potomac do that and keep who you are and learn to separate  you&#39;re who you are and what you feel you need to be doing for your family to keep a sense of yourself that&#39;s probably what I would have induced things for yourself to keep that you sent of yourself that&#39;s probably what are we giving myself 10 years ago  no  no  I know but probably cuz I haven&#39;t gone to a doctor about it cuz I don&#39;t want to know  I mean it&#39;s not I know there were times in my life where I&#39;ve been severely depressed and usually circumstances and had to pull myself out of it but I&#39;d rather pull myself out of it for resorting to treatment  after my mother had died may have been this long battle for a year that we lost and I didn&#39;t know  if I if I was to blame for that it&#39;s like logically knew I wasn&#39;t but  how can I convince myself of that  two weeks after she died I want up with  pulmonary embolisms in one in each long because I didn&#39;t take care of myself for year that they are all I&#39;m 30 years old if you know whatever I do myself I can get over no turned out but I want up having to take more medication because of that it&#39;s been a fight to get my own house back to get to be able to get out of that depression cuz so much of my life was based on being my mother&#39;s daughter office and I didn&#39;t like  the rug was pulled out my like button fell into my world after that so that was the pretty pretty much sent me into a deep depression I&#39;m I almost got divorced because of bad because I didn&#39;t want anything anymore so I know his ex being really distant from my husband by then at that time we were married for about two years at that point I started getting very distant from him pushing everything away.  And feel what am I going to do with the rest of my life now  and  Ben  a fight and then you be there times and no I couldn&#39;t get up  stay in bed and sleep all day but then realizing that  when my mother died I had forecast like after 2 or mine to rehearse so I went up adopting the two that were hers because they don&#39;t have a choice of whether they can go out and get their own food and get their own you want to play  I took that responsibility of doing it for them  so that was one motivating factor was that they didn&#39;t have a choice of whether or not I was going to get up and provide for them I mean I could go without eating I could go that taken care of myself but they couldn&#39;t they didn&#39;t nail so they are they actually got me up and  and they made me go out and face things even though didn&#39;t want to ditch didn&#39;t just kind of want to curl up and die but that would have been my choice not theirs and they I mean what would happen to them if I was there to take care of them they would have been sent to a shelter or whatever probably and maybe they would have not been re-adopt me home and adopted by somebody else maybe they would have been killed for for me meaning for me making a selfish decisions so it&#39;s like I need somebody to take care of to get myself a bit  nuts Acumen a motivating factor is cuz I figured out that it was just me I&#39;d be able to live without a lot of stuff in my car if I wanted it wouldn&#39;t be big deal I wouldn&#39;t care as long as I was doing what I wanted with my life but  I have a family to look after now so I have to go out and do things and I have to go out and look for legitimate work you know dating your day job have to let you know but I&#39;m trying to strike a balance between the two because his what I want to do with my wife but yet I have to take care of my family some homework on a balance of the two  very but it&#39;s worth it I mean  it would be very I have a lot less things to worry about if I just looked at my car and said forget it  but keeping a residence down paying bills things like that  it&#39;s difficult but you have to do it if you want you want any if you ever want anything in your life you have to go through that  I am and I know that but it gets hard sometimes you do want to give up but then it&#39;s like wall what&#39;s the alternative  I mean I don&#39;t think I can live a comfortable life  if I did I wouldn&#39;t do anything I have to be slightly uncomfortable or am I going to do anything with myself I&#39;m just going to be content just hang out all day stay in bed hang out with Mike catherwood ever  and it wouldn&#39;t get anything done  a very anxious and nervous and mean what if  I don&#39;t find  enough you went off work to be able to pay my rent or whatever what if  yo what what if I can&#39;t  keep  a semblance of stability in my life and it&#39;s actually hard work to be stabled and I know it&#39;s hard work to be stable but  what&#39;s answers a lot of what-ifs and anything it&#39;s things that haven&#39;t happened and it&#39;s stupid and pointless to worry about things that haven&#39;t happened and I know that but it&#39;s still have it still protects that&#39;s actually  a source of  anxiety  anxiety go by getting things done figuring things out making a solid plan and going for it  but I know it is a cycle and I&#39;ll go from being really anxious and oh my God what am I going to do what am I going to do the same okay what is  the fundamental thing I need to take care of here  me when what is just extraneous and what can what is what are the actual not issues and what is the actual issue and so figure figure things out that way and then things i t shirt to go with a little bit but then something will pop up in the what if so come up again I&#39;ll have to  figure it out again but I know it&#39;s a cycle I know what seems huge on the surface when you start chipping away at it you get over it pretty quickly get through it  the last time I felt really happy  I don&#39;t know  huh could question like that actually surprisingly stumped me because I do feel happy sometimes sometimes not so much as I just cannae and the middle  really like over joyously happy I don&#39;t know  if not I can&#39;t think of when that happened  I don&#39;t know you don&#39;t know perceptions of other people mean  probably a somebody who  oddly enough somebody who is laid-back and  handle things as they come but I don&#39;t see myself as at at all  as it is  probably that I can think on my feet and I&#39;m not afraid to  hustle my butt off and do whatever I have to do to survive and get things done  that  and I can do it creatively and I try to  strive for balance  play the best things about me  then I&#39;m doing basically what I want with my life which even though it&#39;s not all easy it&#39;s not  I am not financially well-off or anything it&#39;s still a lot more than a lot of people can say about their lives cuz I have an aunt that I really don&#39;t talk to who and the reason why I don&#39;t talk to her because she&#39;s always miserable mean she&#39;s got a career that she  it&#39;s more of a job that she fell into cuz my older aunt loves animals but didn&#39;t want to be a veterinarian so she became a dog groomer and she was actually really good at it she had a stable business for a long time  but her know she tried to get arthritis in her hands and she had that should my cousin&#39;s father went and cut a  stole all the money for her business so she lost your business and she kind of it she retired early cuz between that and that&#39;s why does she want to retiring early she employed my younger Aunt who is still a dog groomer but she hates it and it&#39;s like change your life if you hate your life so much change it  and I think the thing I&#39;m most proud of is  yeah I&#39;m not as financially well-off as she is but I&#39;m doing what I want with my life you know I can be creative I can have creative people around me people who actually like to talk to around me people actually like in my life and be happy with that and they see a lot of people who aren&#39;t and then it gives me a sense of maybe a bloated sense of Southside tracking to be able to say I&#39;m not like that that I&#39;m actually doing what I want even though their sacrifices I&#39;m still fundamentally doing what I want with my life now  thank you  thank you goodbye
429 I look like a cancer patient  okay so now I&#39;m going to  yes  I&#39;m good  Iowa  when are y  2001  holidays and special family events  it&#39;s much better there  and I E I got into UCLA went to UCLA for three years  in the screenwriting program  it took a long time it was difficult  just the  getting used to and managing the stress of everyday living  variety of right here like that  Dallas traffic  internationally no  just haven&#39;t had reason to I guess  I have a BS in math and physics  I went to school later in life and I wanted to actually know something  so it was very difficult very difficult but I did it why  fascinated me I didn&#39;t want to be intimidated by it  oh yeah  to be employed writer  stream Lee difficult extremely difficult writing any type of fictional fiction ride is extremely difficult I worked as hard as I do now when I was in school I have a PhD in math and physics  it&#39;s so hard  outgoing  at the present circumstance it&#39;s it&#39;s not a catch all depends on the the moment  what I do to relax I swim  swam one last Friday  Friday  what do I do when I am annoyed  swear to myself  pretty good pretty good takes a lot to get me to express anger  but I do  it was in traffic actually  that was probably two weeks ago in traffic  sure  I&#39;m just waiting for the lights and some kind of pickups honking at me and like why humpback so he didn&#39;t like that he pulled up alongside me I had to have no idea what his problem was and we had a few words  I mean I have no idea what I was doing wrong  swipe the light  guilty that&#39;s a strong word  if I feel guilty as I feel remorseful about actions or words  said and done in the past they come up  oh just passed in interpersonal reactions with friends are family you know it&#39;ll just hit you one day you&#39;re not necessarily thinking about it for whatever reason and just out of the blue it hits you my all why they say that what I do that  situation  got a blank  for me that question has a negative connotation  so something that&#39;s possibly negative in my recent past  what would have done differently  I don&#39;t  I&#39;m pretty in control of my emotions and taking the temperature of the moment and responding my when to respond when and when not to respond  so nothing really Springs to mind that I wish I&#39;d done differently recently in my pass pass yes but not recently  oh  swallowing my pride  putting my tail between my legs  and saying I was wrong to friends  I contacted him again and then we&#39;re fast friends again  now this is again this is past past so not recent past so  probably  altercations I&#39;ve had with my mom  and I know things I&#39;ve said to hurt her  I know  yeah when you  hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks  so any time any one of those situations you know  so when I think my emotional IQ has  ground so I think in the past passed my emotional cues was stuck on infant so  so  I have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters and their families my father never had a good relationship don&#39;t know if that will be possibly still alive but he&#39;s Advanced Alzheimer&#39;s so he&#39;s mad at everybody right now I was fine it was slow  Psalm 100  impossible Foods my life  my sister&#39;s to talk with my sisters  extremely easy asleep while it&#39;s night anywhere from at least 8 to 10 hours a night  oh star Jake  just going through the motions you know like this I like this David Lynch who is not necessarily mainstream he&#39;s done some crazy stuff are his movies and TVs concerned he said the idea of the tanks driven artist is BS because you want to be creative get a good night sleep I like that  good I can&#39;t wait to get up and start the day  oh if if that happens it&#39;s gradual I&#39;m always thinking about my behavior and my thought processes and how to be more productive in my life  with what  pme me now I don&#39;t know I haven&#39;t been taking diagnosed with any psychological  acronym  no  this weekend had a good good time with friends with great was with friends and we just were able to talk about you know some things and conversation lasted two and a half hour 3 hours to inspect it to happen was good I like talking with smart people informed people open-minded people it was a great those types of discussions are rare  almost like how you get after running or exercising you know the endorphins it was the same thing  I am  ADD with friends or working on my stuff my writing  for exercising  my Heights I wish I were taller  I wish  color of the physicality I wish I didn&#39;t wear glasses  nothing internal  I&#39;m patience I&#39;ve been commended for my patience by strangers  my relationships with my friends and my family I understand that it takes time and energy to maintain them and I take that time and energy  well it&#39;s a really open general question of course now goes back are you talkin recently are you talkin in the path  I always regret  I regret  the whole thing&#39;s not a big thing not being more productive or efficient in the use of my time each day  I hate wasting time I hate wasting money I hate wasting energy  that&#39;s a deep question  I&#39;d say  I was co-dependent 10 or 20 years ago I said get some help  get some help  you got your coat  sure  I just about button

Running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business  I know not know I&#39;m in it also an apartment manager keeps me tied down  it&#39;s a fair it&#39;s not the greatest because of being a department manager I do have free rent but I have to stay  they&#39;re a lot so  that part does the refrigerant part is very good  oh gosh  a most memorable experience  it&#39;s hard to say  well  I mean there&#39;s good and bad memorable experiences  oh well I guess I&#39;m like sports success when I was in high school and a few other things that I was happy about and some art pieces I&#39;ve made were memorable and  some bad things would be my father&#39;s stats right now but those are very memorable not good though  call my parents and have a lot of brothers and sisters so my family  are you to your family  a fairly close the most of them live around at La  I just a few that are from  distant my brother lives in New York and  my other brother lives in Maui  how mostly very talented  just stem more involved in technology then maybe I was or I am and they are  I think they&#39;re more of a hive mind and when I grow up SIMs like they were all hooked into social media  hi is going to walk or watch television  carplay with my computer  and I  well  there&#39;s some  there&#39;s some kind of  Injustice has that happening not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new District parking text kind of upsetting and this city doesn&#39;t seem to Anna  I make any exceptions or change the rules  and also some unfair things at work sometimes happened that are  got that are upsetting  oh yeah I work in at a high Sky worked at a high school dance this last weekend and when we arrived at this site  the people at the site said we couldn&#39;t set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it and we had to go outside  and then to get in okay to go inside because being outside we weren&#39;t prepared for nor told in advance that we were to be outside it delayed our set-up time and that does wouldn&#39;t have bothered me except that on Monday morning the school called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait until we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting in  and our work doesn&#39;t back us up at the at the office they just need to place the school to maintain the account so often when that something like that happens that means they will not send you out to work at that school again which which translated to less payroll hours for the photographers that were on that job  that&#39;s how that&#39;s how they do things  so that that is upsetting  most of the time that dust off my resume and start looking for other situation Setter yeah  a pretty good are you sure that you might die in the moment I don&#39;t really lose it but later I might prevent or something like that went on the on the location I wouldn&#39;t do that  well just today we have a tight schedule today and I have a friend that I&#39;m sharing a car with today and we  we were arguing where to go first  10 time so we compromised and did most of her things in one of my things then after this was one of the things this over then we&#39;re going to do some of her things  no  post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is  no  yes  what&#39;s a 1980  yeah I think Believe It Was 1980 yeah  my father noticed some symptoms my father&#39;s is just passed away but it was the psychiatrist  well I wasn&#39;t sleeping I was laying around the house  miss waking up at  noon Sunday and I didn&#39;t have a focusrite for getting a job it wasn&#39;t clear enough I remember some job interviews that I&#39;ve go to their front door and then I wouldn&#39;t go in and I think that was all I&#39;ll part of depression  yeah I thought I had a problem but I didn&#39;t know what it was  no  well and I went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that you thought that I was done it but in it and I I did get too much better place I have to watch all the time to see what&#39;s going on with depression so I think I&#39;ll have good days and bad days  I think therapy makes you see what the  like that I thought of it as a filter or wearing a as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don&#39;t really you see everything through that so you have to I have to sort of try to take the glasses off for a little bit and double-check and my really receiving these things accurately  or am I seeing it through with a depressed few point when I try to look for clues about that  I think I am  slipping back a little bit. I don&#39;t do well during unemployed. I&#39;ve noticed in my path in my past and right now we have a work slowdown so it&#39;s easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedules too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person I think that structure is really important to get you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people and those are all beneficial things for someone who tends to be depressed  well I don&#39;t know if it changes its a little bit I said to be focused on some things that are probably not that uplifting lightsaber but it&#39;s more negative like I  I&#39;ve been sort of thinking about how soldiers in the past I don&#39;t know why but like the end during the Roman era or the ancient Greeks how it would have been like to be in the in a Frontline battle with just kind of in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  I don&#39;t know I set my mind seems to go there a lot I&#39;m just thinking about that and I&#39;ve been looking at it and reading books about that or video clips on YouTube  and things like that or some other kind of like terrible Doom type things like I was watching on that animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  we&#39;re probably shouldn&#39;t dwell so much on that  I am in life in general yeah well  I think I regret not finishing College I think I had a I think I was going into depression right then it wasn&#39;t coping in my senior year very well and didn&#39;t really I didn&#39;t get out of college with a degree although I was there seven years but so that&#39;s very that&#39;s a big regret that I have  I think it would have been to  at certain points I probably should have sought therapy and also probably some outside help just with getting through finals just the logistics I had I had was an art major and I had no car so  a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth in and also to meet at away locations I think it probably would have been worth it to  do whatever it took to get a car at that time  so  well I&#39;m Ivan tell them very patient and also I have some original original artistic ideas so  those are those are good qualities I&#39;m very loyal and and also  and I support my friends fairly generous with them so  it&#39;s a  I said I really enjoyed it was I had a  I had a nice experience. Just photographing out a soccer game recently  that really enjoyed that so  okay  it&#39;s my pleasure thank you goodbye  I&#39;ll head to bed  let&#39;s write interesting
312 that should I move my arms around  and I&#39;m going to start at 10  if it&#39;s not it was said don&#39;t answer that make sense  I don&#39;t ask that that&#39;s all okay that&#39;s all.  Okay  impressive  are you okay  yes  fine how about you  here  yes  the weather  weather mainly near the met the weather sorry  not the people put some of the people stuff like that so  okay I&#39;m cutting you off  not as much as I used to  I used to be in school they sell a lot of places for conferences think that that put me out of school right now but later I&#39;ll get back into school. Shelmore right now  I don&#39;t  I don&#39;t enjoy traveling  ask a question that&#39;s pretty good all I study Physics and it&#39;s mainly  Ashley  run out east Community College physics and astronomy research and physics also because I like the type of thing I want me to Grass will hopefully that&#39;s why I&#39;m nervous sometime from the questionnaire  impressive  professor at a place like USC or UCLA it&#39;s not that where the professors do three hours work a week in the grasses to the rest  you&#39;re actually pretty good at this  I got this lot of people the first one I guess is my physics teaching AP Physics tutoring high school even though you just let me to be Engineers have a physics major he still was a very good if what he told me you know he&#39;s fertile tell me that  school is not about a grave about learning  okay  oh pretty good I think  I&#39;m single so I don&#39;t get too many arguments but it&#39;s part of my brother about  hiddleswift to play a video game together I know I&#39;m pretty old for this  really close a sedum praealtum pair to see a couple times a week older try to help me with groceries things iPad and a brother I see same same same old same time my sister I tutor her kids my nephew&#39;s so I see him but once we go so  yes  because I spend long. Of time doing math and reading and not talking anybody message.  I guess I play video games or it&#39;ll work out I work out I think a lot I try to at least  I rolled my eyes which happened towards a bad thing and let&#39;s put it I think  bad parenting basically parents are more self-centered more than themselves and representations and the kids just do they won&#39;t be compared to Art their opinion  I guess  thank you  I only have best friend  it&#39;s a remember  unbiased obviously but they are  I really good math I&#39;m not really sure if you can&#39;t that&#39;s why you can&#39;t get better than that but thing is it&#39;s just have to get recertified conference with it where no matter what it is going to learn in math class. Out I am patient I think and I am just went where I can swim I can spend many hours many many many hours would be books that might not be important but they might be important to do anyway that&#39;s a bad thing  when I a good workout  Google video game small little things like that when something happens when my not researched I think mathematical physics type thing where it goes well that must put a book that puts me in a good mood  thank you  right now  is it that that  research that I did I did make it this far  research why that&#39;s all  that&#39;s all  interesting  we start off in school read about I say things like that he&#39;s a general tutoring hero particle physics and no idea what it is you know it&#39;s very complicated because iCloud mechanics and you still have that and but you not sure if I should make it and eventually he still has lot of time goes by you reach you as time goes on you can get closer closer emission Mexico I miss you realize you are just men as good as we are up there you can do research and visit you can&#39;t admit knowledge  okay  a few weeks ago when I got a good grade in the class  thank you  yes briefly  many years ago  I don&#39;t know she&#39;s always growing up I always thought I was always thought Dreamworld the kid that&#39;s why and I just we&#39;re not doing that  I was National Guard or I think about 18 19 I got commissioned at2021 as longing for about a year so I let it 2022  yes. Really  I don&#39;t think it did I think I just need to grow up your butt or expecting to be as much  graduate school  in physics  no  nope  it depends when I work out really hard at night of the day of the day before if I work out pretty hard as bad if I don&#39;t workout it I don&#39;t know it&#39;s hard moderately  thank you  yes  it&#39;s okay  probably like I am now normal I think not as not as happy about everything was still pretty okay still function  no  hey sliding  no  yes  yes I have changed my thoughts  applying to grad school games been a while and slightly apprehensive happy that looks good but every answer is that it might not be good things like that  what do you mean by that is I know so you could Peter but I didn&#39;t how hard to do these thoughts or how hard is it going to grad school  understand  okay  I agree  no not really  how to keep doing what you do even though I&#39;m not that old believe it or not 20 years ago was probably 15 kit for 12 workout if I work if it was a little bit different don&#39;t think it&#39;ll work out so well it was a perfect now they were doing really well personally  thank you  same here  goodbye  I&#39;ll keep this on  take us off now
602 this is super need I like this  me either at all can you do it at home  wow  okay  alrighty  yes I am  hopefully fine thanks for asking  I&#39;m originally from California born and raised and I live in Carson at the moment  all of the beaches the sun in the amusement parks  the traffic LA traffic is hectic  not really  I read and I listen to soft music like jazz or something  I don&#39;t like people to walk in front of me don&#39;t excuse me cut me off in traffic when I&#39;m driving I don&#39;t like a Tailgater little small small, small remarks that people make them upset me I just don&#39;t want to be I&#39;m Easily Aggravated so I don&#39;t have to be aggravated  I&#39;m pretty good at controlling it sometimes but at times I can get very irate so I&#39;m working on that right now  do I have an argument almost a year but when I did it was over a girl that was my ex boyfriend it was over female but it&#39;s over now so I haven&#39;t had any real argument since almost a year  I studied in college I did a child of element and I also study computer science  right now I&#39;m a homemaker I don&#39;t work at all I haven&#39;t been working in about 3 months now was laid off but I was doing receptionist work so I&#39;m currently looking for employment at this moment  my dream job is all my own design Graphics computer shop which means I&#39;m when you do your you grab your designs online and you send them to different distributors and what they do is they approve or they approve or disapprove what you put they like or dislike about the design so they went ahead with it they&#39;ll buy them for me and then they&#39;ll go from there  I don&#39;t know I used to in the past but not at the moment  when I was with my daughter my mom it was very delightful we stay from was 2 weeks and it was not even two years ago it was very very nice and I wish I can go back to the beaches for beautiful the food is great the blue owls are great at night it was really really nice a great experience  very close to my mother and my daughter were all three were like sisters we can be any closer  my parents my grandparents who have now gone there if they&#39;re past but they were a very positive influence in my life my guy friend that I&#39;m dating now he&#39;s very positive in my life so  I have a lot of backbone support you can say  I don&#39;t right now because I&#39;m living with my mother step dad I&#39;m trying to move someplace on my own now but it&#39;s kind of hard not working at all so I just have to wing it out so I can do better  no it&#39;s just myself my daughter my mom and my stepdad at the moment  no I haven&#39;t  yes I have  almost 2 years now  no I had no idea  just always feeling down and out cleaning myself in not want to be bothered with other the outside world just a little mood swings and just can&#39;t sleep at night all all kind of little stuff that kind of got me feeling like something wasn&#39;t right about me  yes I do  yes I do it&#39;s very useful  it is very much so  reason why I feel like it&#39;s helping me is because the lady NYC there the therapy place she&#39;s very nice she she&#39;s willing to help out in any way she can she&#39;s almost to be like a psychiatrist she&#39;s very good I mean she talked to me about things encourage me to what not to do what you do to help calm down to feel better and she&#39;s very nice or all-in-all I always leave their confidence all the time  number one of my mood swings I&#39;ve noticed a big change in that and my attitude  affected me in a great way I would never say negative because I like like I said it goes back to the helpfulness after scene from The Lady and I&#39;m a therapist and  the different ways I was coached on how to improve my lifestyle to avoid the problem that I do have right now or suffer with so that&#39;s how it affected me that way  the attitudes and mood swings can&#39;t sleep at night depressed all the time no outside company at all didn&#39;t want to be bothered with anybody friends or family locked up in my room all the time halfway not wanting to eat or overeating it was just a lot  maybe like any little thing would trigger me off like somebody say something wrong to me that I would think was wrong it would just figured I would just get triggered and just snapped for no reason it&#39;s just I don&#39;t know what would cause it besides that  well now I&#39;m doing I&#39;m coping with it by not snapping his medicine just trying to stay calm and I just need a lot of positive environment around me not negativity that helps to so with that being said I just kind of maintain and keep my high self-esteem up is As much as I can  a lot better than before  yes I have very positive thoughts very positive behavior much better than what it was very big improvement from before  yes I have been for the past few months I&#39;ve been feeling a little better  I have at times but today no I&#39;m feeling pretty upbeat  it&#39;s not very easy but I try but for the past few nights I have a sleepy the full night so that&#39;s a positive for me  very cranky very groggy Moody  actually  yesterday that we see something was up over the phone and I was happy the whole day I&#39;m still kind of happy about a tattoo so that was very good for me  my best friend is a male he would probably surprise me as upbeat always ready to go  luv2eat  just a fun person to be around  no I don&#39;t got anything  thank you for having me  bye  love it
669 I just say I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m not  I&#39;m ready to rock and roll  are we on camera  is it a she or he  oh there she has where&#39;s your face we&#39;re not going to see your face wow  her seen this before  so once again I ministered her up and then went to after she&#39;s done she&#39;ll tell you the environment  pretty cool  I&#39;m not a therapist but I&#39;m here  and please  I&#39;m fine  oh I&#39;m feeling pretty good I had a little I was a little bit  I wasn&#39;t sure what to expect when I got here but I feel pretty comfortable now  I feel fine  I&#39;m very upbeat and in a good mood and happy  Feeling Good  great  where are you from originally I&#39;m from New Jersey born and raised in New Jersey  went to basic training in New Jersey at Fort Dix drafted into the army when I was 17  well  I don&#39;t like it&#39;s just too crowded in La there&#39;s just too many people and it&#39;s just everybody to rush rush and  I like a little more slow-paced  but I do like the weather here so that&#39;s where I&#39;m here and my family is here  that&#39;s what brought me here  do you travel a lot  I traveled when I was younger when I got out of the military because I wasn&#39;t sure exactly what I was  looking to do with my life and but now I&#39;m kind of settled in and going to school for culinary arts  in Hollywood and I have a fiance who graduated from USC and I&#39;m pretty happy with my life  but traveling not too much anymore now  what do you enjoy about  going to new places and meeting new people and seeing other parts of the country I haven&#39;t been to Europe but I hope to get there someday  especially about it  for credit number years I lived in Louis in New Orleans Louisiana took a trip there  and enjoyed the food was fantastic and the music was fantastic and the weather was great  and I loved it there  and I took a truck back taking a trip to Las Vegas  because I used to be a gambler at one time but  not anymore  that&#39;s about it  I&#39;d rather not talk about that  well I&#39;m currently enrolled in a culinary arts school  but I got my GED in the military  and so now I&#39;m taking a culinary arts to be a chef  I hope to open up a restaurant someday  I&#39;m going to school I&#39;m going to school in  and I work part-time  my dream job is to own a bed and breakfast with my fiance that&#39;s my dream job  and I hope to make that come true within the next year or two  do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  probably more shy than not going I was much I was very shy when I was growing up but I&#39;m still shy but I&#39;m trying to break out of my shell so to speak  well my mom and dad are no longer with us they passed on  and I have a sister in Northern California  we were never close so we don&#39;t communicate very much and  which is probably partially my fault parsley her fault we just don&#39;t seem to have a lot in common to show  my mom passed away and that was pretty rough she was pretty sick by dad passed away about 9 years ago from Alzheimer&#39;s so  we had a good relationship.  to relax I just like to go take walks take long walks on the beach  read a book  watch live sports on TV  I love the outdoors so I love to get out and exercise whenever I can that&#39;s what I do  how are you  very good very good  very good  I don&#39;t have a temper I don&#39;t get mad very out it takes a lot for me to get very very mad at somebody I&#39;m cutting easygoing guy  no  no not really and I I try to avoid trouble whenever I can sometimes you can&#39;t avoid it but I try  I&#39;m fine  probably arguing about with my roommate about making too much noise when he gets up in the morning and you know silly things like that but  when you live in that kind of environment you have to learn to live with other people and  it&#39;s kind of rough but you do the best you can  I like you. I don&#39;t really want to discuss that later would rather not I&#39;d rather avoid that question  all right  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  probably  not getting enough education when I was younger and I had problems in school and  running away from home when  disappointing my family things like that I had a bad childhood due to my fault though she not theirs but I made the wrong decision which I&#39;m paying for now so  but we have to move ahead  the hardest decision I had to make was  putting my mom to rest  thought that was the hardest and it&#39;s been about 2 years now but  I&#39;m still not over that one so that was the hardest  she was my best friend so  now she&#39;s gone  my early years before I went into the military I didn&#39;t have many friends I was very shy very bad in school I wish I would have paid more attention  I probably in better better position now but  it&#39;s too late to worry about that now so we have to move on  and with the acquisition support and help with my fiance that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing  have you ever served in the middle  yes I was in the Army in Vietnam back in the day when I was 17  how is your food service worker in the military  many years ago  17 I was drafted  19  7 / 70 or 71 I can remember it&#39;s been a long time  I was drafted I didn&#39;t have a choice and really so  how was drafted  so I went in the army  which was a good experience actually  yes I am  yeah and now I&#39;m getting help from the military so that&#39;s a good thing  no I was Stateside all the time I was in the military I was stationed in New Jersey  Georgia Texas  that&#39;s right I&#39;m respected Fort Hood Texas  it was well do the fact that I didn&#39;t go overseas or she combat it was fairly easy you know it was hard leaving home at that young age but it was fairly easy I didn&#39;t have much, I had some problems in the military but  I missed him a lot and miss my family but it was okay it was a good experience I&#39;m glad I did it  that&#39;s when I started traveling traveling a lot because I didn&#39;t know  are we still young and I wanted to see the country and travel around work here work there good job you got a job there just thought I should have been going to the school and while I was young and getting it having a decent job now instead of starting at the age of 60 but they say it&#39;s never too late so here I am  I&#39;ll be okay I&#39;ll be alright  well it turned me into a man that&#39;s for sure  yeah and maybe become no more responsible  learn to take learn to be on my own  well I have my good days and bad days because I&#39;m on this new medication for depression so some days I don&#39;t feel good and  I have other medical issues I have breathing problems and I have  some other medical issues but most of the time I feel pretty good but there are they there are good days and bad days  I just take it one day at a time  have you noticed any changes  well I just know I don&#39;t sleep well matter fact I hardly sleep at all which is not good  and then like I say I have my depressing days and days where I just don&#39;t have any energy and don&#39;t feel like doing anything and then  I have my good days with my fiance to go to the best because she&#39;s my  pride and joy  without her I don&#39;t know where I&#39;d be  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep very difficult very difficult about 3 to 4 hours a night last night I woke up at about 3 in the morning and I never could go back to sleep  that&#39;s not good but yeah my sleeping is very bad  it seems to get worse and worse everyday  I&#39;m not quite sure how I guess just I don&#39;t have the answer to that question I don&#39;t know  never used to be that way  all right I don&#39;t know  well  I have no energy and I get grouchy I&#39;m very restless  tired of course because I haven&#39;t slept  I do the best I can  have you ever been diagnosed  I&#39;m not sure what that is I don&#39;t know what that is  well I don&#39;t know what that is I was never diagnosed with anything but you know they want to put me on some sleeping pills but I try and stay away from as much pills as I can I really don&#39;t like to take a lot of medications but there&#39;s some medications I have to take  such as I have medications for my anxiety and my depression things like that I have to have those but other than that I&#39;d rather stay away from medications if possible  well I have the I have anxiety  attacks that I&#39;ve had for the last three or four years would you put me in the hospital but as long as I stay up on my medication I&#39;m okay but I have stomach problems  I&#39;m just other issues  so it&#39;s just a day-to-day thing I deal with it the best I can  I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not an I really don&#39;t know I just like I started do some  problems when I was losing my I thought I was losing my eyesight because I had my iPod with popping out to do a thyroid problem I had and so they put me on this medication that I can&#39;t get off of now I&#39;ve been on it for about 4 years 5 years and I&#39;ll probably out the rest of my life I have to take it twice a day or I will end up in the emergency room which I have before  but I&#39;m okay  all right  how do you cope with them  I just try and I just deal with it the best I can go out and  take a walker  engaging some physical activities you know go to the beach like I said before and things like that keep my mind occupied  how&#39;s the best way  okay  well because I wasn&#39;t sure what was wrong with me and I was just because I was feeling sick every day  which is not natural so I had to go see a doctor psychiatrist not because I&#39;m crazy just because I needed some help some medication and they gave me this medication that they did tell me that it was addictive  and it&#39;s highly addictive and I&#39;ve been on it for like I said about four years now and I&#39;ll probably be out of the rest of my life so but it keeps me  feeling okay  I can deal with things  well I have an appointment tomorrow is a psychiatrist and yes I do  not that often as long as I keep on my medication I&#39;m okay  do you feel therapy is useful  well the last time I was in therapy with the psychiatrist all they did was  it wasn&#39;t very much of a help because they were talking to me about my family and things like that and they weren&#39;t really helping me any so  I don&#39;t go to therapy that often it&#39;s not a regular thing  I just go to see a psychiatrist and that was the first time I&#39;ve gone and it just all session lasted about 10 minutes how&#39;s your family where they live blah blah blah blah blah blah  nothing about me and my problems and I never went back so I do have an appointment tomorrow with a different psychiatrist to see if I can get some more help and because I find Working is very hard because of my problems with my stomach and my breathing and if so I&#39;m trying to  hopefully get on some disability you know I&#39;m 60 years old and  finding a job especially in these times is not that easy so we&#39;ll see what happens  because I don&#39;t I need it I need some income you know and I can&#39;t be little bit too young to retire so I need to be put on disability  so hopefully I get some help  none actually none  sad to say but it&#39;s true  like I said I don&#39;t go on a regular basis so it&#39;s been a while I will see what happens tomorrow  when was the last  I feel pretty happy right now  and we want I want to wish my fiance I&#39;m always happy because she&#39;s a very puppy positive person and we&#39;re in love and  nothing like being in love  so that&#39;s what I&#39;m most happy when I&#39;m with her because we have a lot in common and we have fun together  I love her  she&#39;s very supportive  yes she has been for the last 3 years  well I met her when she she&#39;s a paralegal and I met her during the time when my mom passed away and she was worth for the attorney that was helping us with the selling of the house Friday of the money in this and that we kind of went out for a cup of coffee and we started to  enjoy each other&#39;s company  friendly dependable and reliable  well is my 60th birthday the other day  and show me my fiance made me a nice dinner and we spent the weekend together and we went to the beach and  we just had a good old time sitting in the backyard  barbecuing  enjoying ourselves  that was great  yeah I was right  well that I&#39;m 60 years old and still have a full head of hair and still fairly healthy and  about to be married  that&#39;s what I&#39;m most proud of right now  found somebody to love me and somebody that I love  that&#39;s great  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me thank you  goodbye
379 all right  thank you  are you okay with this yes  if you want okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good  I&#39;m actually originally from Woodland Hills which is out in the San Fernando Valley was born there and then I moved to Lomita which is in Los Angeles County about probably around 1993 so I&#39;m going to 23 now so it&#39;s about what is 19 years or so I&#39;ve been living there now  some things that I really like I would have to say you know the beach you know not so much the traffic don&#39;t really care for that but definitely you know just kind of like The Nightlife you know just people in general I like conversing with others so  right dip  you travel  yeah actually I do I mean I can&#39;t see your shoes but yeah actually I do travel a lot I&#39;ve been to places like Hawaii been to the Caribbean I&#39;ve been to see you know just different places like Arizona I&#39;ve been to Oregon Washington pretty much all over I would say so but usually mainly like why the Caribbean Mexico as well so yep  I think it&#39;s just the experience you know I&#39;d like you can&#39;t you can kind of experience the culture of different people you know just just the whole background the scenery it&#39;s just you know it&#39;s it&#39;s something new to experience I would say something that you know people haven&#39;t seen before so  will it see I recently took a trip to Hawaii a couple months ago I was back in December was around Christmas time New Year&#39;s so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different Islands we went to let&#39;s see I think it was Kawaii went to Oahu Maui you know places like that so  you know I would have to say that you know probably like in Hawaii or like the Caribbean you know just like I said before the whole experience Factor just seeing you know new different things things that are unique so  actually study journalism right now I&#39;m in my final semester so I&#39;m about to graduate couple months  skip  well you know it&#39;s kind of funny cuz you know I started off at a two-year Community College and so you know I was going into my business management something to do with you know I think basically accounting but you know I kind of figured that wasn&#39;t for me so I decided to go into journalism because I couldn&#39;t I mean you know it probably still be sitting at a desk but you know Lisa journalism I can go on the field and I&#39;ll talk to people and you know you know receive information gathering information that sort of deal and then you don&#39;t write up stories I just thought it was you I was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kind of crunching numbers all day so  my dream job I would have to say you know something something and maybe radio broadcasting sports broadcasting you know I think that would be really interesting something that&#39;s definitely a passion of mine so  tell me about your relationship with you  my relationship with my family it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty good you know I lose my parents still like I said I&#39;m 23 years old you know there&#39;s certain times when I can be a little bit shaky little bit Rocky but for the most part it&#39;s it&#39;s pretty good you know I&#39;ve matured a lot in the last few years so things are getting back up to speed I would say things are things are going pretty well  you know I think it&#39;s them somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative the people when I&#39;m relaxed and laid-back other times I kind of it&#39;s not so much like I go into my shell but you know it&#39;s times like I can be kind of shy if I don&#39;t know people as well or if I haven&#39;t never met them before so it&#39;s one of those things that Kanye kind of got to meet me in the Middle with it because you know I can neither be talked very talkative or a x you know I can be a little bit shy but you know once I once I get the conversation going really talkative then so  hey  I&#39;m you know usually I would listen to music or you know maybe just you know can I go for a drive or you know hang out with my friends you know it just something did just the kind that you know he&#39;s he&#39;s that cuz you know like I said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just want to relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy so  you know I&#39;ve actually been better with that couple years back unite points were like I pretty much couldn&#39;t control my temper like whatsoever and I I mean I would just pretty much get angry you know the littlest things everything would just kind of ticked me off but you know I&#39;ve definitely learned to you no control that sort of thing and you know it may be a better person because of it  well let&#39;s see I&#39;m trying to think it&#39;s it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe I can&#39;t remember off the top of my head but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s always something so minuscule that that&#39;s why I probably don&#39;t remember it but you eventually we make up and I apologize for it because you know I accept that you know I&#39;m wrong and you know certain circumstances  when you feel guilty about  something that I feel guilty about probably you know not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past you know I mean that is the past and you know I don&#39;t like this wall in that sort of thing but I think that&#39;s one thing that I tried to work on but it&#39;s also one thing that I kind of regret not doing just being just being nice  Precision I ever had to make a pretty recent kind of tough because I actually have a buddy he was in the Air Force and you recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and it&#39;s hard for me to talk to him because you know he&#39;s not really all there anymore like we used to be so it&#39;s one of those things where I feel like I&#39;m kind of ignoring him and I don&#39;t want to do that but at the same time I don&#39;t know is Tennessee&#39;s you could be a little crazy so  probably like me on some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so I don&#39;t know but yeah  yeah it&#39;s pretty tough and I cuz we go way back been best friends with them since I was about five six years old so it&#39;s just it&#39;s just really hard to deal with but you know I try to I don&#39;t I don&#39;t you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it&#39;s it&#39;s always there I don&#39;t ever forget so  your best friend  my best friend  well you probably say that you know I&#39;m a pretty pretty down-to-earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know I try to work on that to you probably say that I&#39;m pretty funny I like to hang out you know just kind of do things here and there you know I&#39;m just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watching movies and I&#39;ll grab a few beers I started deal so  yeah it varies sometimes it&#39;s easier than others you know if I&#39;m really tired and you know I&#39;ll probably have a very good sleep I&#39;ve been sleeping all that great the last few days cuz you know my house there&#39;s workers on the roof so they&#39;re you&#39;re putting in the new Roofing so that&#39;s kind of tough that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part usually get pretty good sleep  feeling lately lately I feel pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up I actually got an internship about a month ago for you know my field of Journalism so that&#39;s good about to graduate in two months so I&#39;m looking forward to that I&#39;m starting to make a little bit more money that&#39;s you know that&#39;s good and yeah things are just going pretty well right now I can&#39;t complain  yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s not bad you know like I said it could always be worse right but you know I&#39;m enjoying life so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the best part  I&#39;ve not know  nope  last time I felt really happy man you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had a sanity I guess you could say I came back to visit from the Air Force you get some leave so you know you&#39;re just hanging out no just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that was nice but I miss that you know so  I feel great do you know it because there&#39;s nothing like having a best friend and you can have conversation you know 24/7 about anyting you tell anything to him in confidence and you can tell me anything in confidence is like it&#39;s hard to find especially someone that you&#39;ve known for so many years and then you can&#39;t really get it back now so  is there any regret  yeah there there&#39;s a probably one or two things that I regret well I mean I got a DUI about three or four years ago actually was four years ago that&#39;s something that I definitely regret because you know I look back on it and you know things might have been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions no circumstances that took place so you know I may end up in you. I guess I think I better off for it but at the same time you know it&#39;s always going to be in the back of my mind like I said it&#39;s just one of those things you have to do within your own way  advice would you give yourself  well you know it&#39;s one of those things like I was a child then so I really don&#39;t know what to say I mean even if I would have listened then who knows but you know I probably would have told myself you know just be careful you don&#39;t make sure you can be the best person you possibly can candy basically you know just always be nice be honest just be caring for others so  probably going back to my buddy with the whole paranoid schizophrenic thing I don&#39;t say that I wish I could erase it I just wish that it didn&#39;t happen like that so  send your ideal weekend my dear weekend I usually keep it pretty pretty generic I going to hang out with my friends either you know we hang out in the day no do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies now just the standard stuff that people do if so  what are some things you wish you could change about you  some things that I wish I could change  probably just you know be nicer like I said before baby not being as lazy have more determination I mean I I have quite a bit of determination I know what I want to do with my life but I know there were times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical and so I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate is much so  well you know it&#39;s it&#39;s tough to think back but I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad as you know I would say probably like when I was kind of getting angry at certain people maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn&#39;t have I&#39;ll try to give him more constructive criticism but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of characters  okay  the best qualities I would say that I&#39;m definitely hardworking I&#39;m determined a very caring now More Than I Used to Be  very honest and you know I just I love to talk to people like I like making new relationships I like making people laugh  something that I did recently that I really enjoyed you know it&#39;s probably over at my internship I was just going to write a story or two and it just felt good you know to get those stories done eventually they&#39;re going to go into the paper so I feel accomplished about that you know it&#39;s one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there you know it&#39;s right in your face and you can tell yourself you don&#39;t like I did that so makes me feel good  you know just let&#39;s see a few different stories that just usually things about will the papers in Long Beach so it&#39;s usually about you know stories are events that are taking place in Long Beach so  I would say that I&#39;m most proud of you know graduating high school. Graduate college hopefully you know I was going to earn a degree and then hopefully get a good solid job you know the near future I think that&#39;s one thing that I&#39;m most proud of  thank you  so we value your feedback so  after you take care with your answer
406 okay  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  creative  are you okay with this yes  I&#39;m doing good  I&#39;m originally from Southern California  I like the downtown Theater District I like the beaches I I like the variety of stuff that you can do in one day  well sometimes I don&#39;t like the traffic I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really too much I don&#39;t like about La I really like it like that oh  no I haven&#39;t really travel in about 5 years  oh I just haven&#39;t been able to travel  I just haven&#39;t travel  I like going to new places and seeing things I haven&#39;t seen before and if I can like visiting places like landmarks  I want to hear that one of your trips  well the last one I did was San Francisco that wasn&#39;t so far but I got to stay in downtown San Francisco and I got to go shopping and I got to get on him the streetcar so that was cool  well I still study I&#39;m studying psychology  well  I decided to go back to school just pretty quickly so I went to Junior College and then when it got close to graduate I knew I want to transfer so  I taking a couple psychology course is not decided I liked it so I just decide to make that my major and I thought I didn&#39;t have a lot of math but it had enough math  are you happy  well now that I&#39;m almost done I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to continue in that area  dream job  well would I wanted initially was to get in the sport psychology but I&#39;m not quite sure that&#39;s what I want either  okay  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  well I have to be shy initially but once you get to know me I&#39;m outgoing  what I&#39;m feeling  I turn on the fish tank screensaver I think I either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on Netflix  like what what does a good movie I like four movies a lot so a lot of right now I&#39;m into martial arts movie with subtitles so  I think I&#39;m pretty good  when was the  you know I know  they&#39;re not really long arguments I don&#39;t know if there were arguments I know I argue with my boyfriend and he hung up for my face so I don&#39;t know why and it got soft pretty quickly so I don&#39;t know if it was really that important  when I walked out without saying okay  I can&#39;t think of one right now  I think  the hardest decision I probably had to make was moving from will back to California from Oregon  can you tell me about that  but I was really young so I was  19/20 and I was really by myself so that was pretty hard cuz I obviously had to support myself  what made you decide to do that because it was a really really boring in Oregon so I really like the activity here in LA  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  you know I don&#39;t really feel guilty about many things  okay  tell me about your relationship with your family  well I don&#39;t talk to them that much my dad and my stepmom live in Oregon so I probably talked to on the phone at least once or twice a month and then when I come out here I want to say at least once a year sometimes you can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often and I see them about it but I&#39;m pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well yeah  what have lots of positive influences I think I&#39;m just regular people are come across you know maybe someone off work with maybe I&#39;ll actually my uncle he&#39;s a really good positive but he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice  like what about life  you know I don&#39;t really think I&#39;ve had anything that bad happen to me where I just don&#39;t  what bothers me so much I have to not think about it  well I can&#39;t say pretty easy cuz I work schedule and then I go to school but  I want to go to sleep I sleep really well those long as I have enough you know hours  feeling lately really really happy and good  nope  no  always happy hour yesterday  I&#39;m just happy anytime I talk to my boyfriend or if I go out and do something I&#39;m just happy I got off work I&#39;m happy cuz I&#39;m done for the day I&#39;m just really happy I&#39;m on spring break I&#39;m really happy right now so  awesome  something you did read  oh I haven&#39;t done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat but the last activity that I had a lot of fun doing with ice skating in December 10th in downtown LA  is there anything you regret know I don&#39;t really have too many regrets I mean whatever happens happens and you know was meant to play out that way  advice cuz you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  well  I guess I would say don&#39;t worry too much about the small things  even though they seem really big it really they really are insignificant and you won&#39;t think about it in 6 months from now  okay  I think my best qualities are I&#39;m a happy person I&#39;m a fun person I&#39;m pretty easy to get along with I think most people like me and I&#39;m just a cool person  well I wish I could study more I wish I would study more I wish that I would exercise more and I wish that I think that&#39;s it right there  tell me about  I don&#39;t think I want to talk about that  okay  what are you most proud of in your life  I don&#39;t know I guess I&#39;m just taking care of myself supporting myself not having to go back home I guess that&#39;s about the best accomplishment there is  thank you  bye  okay is that you and the other end  all right so you can move back over to that computer will have you do a quick phone service
373 give me Tessa levels or 9  Alka  how do I get an avatar of this stuff too  now she&#39;s going to ask you some questions and when she&#39;s done she will let you know and I&#39;m all right  thank you very much  creative  and please  are you okay with  yes  doing okay  North Carolina  yep  almost four years ago  Majin Buu  I graduated college and internship out here for production company so I started doing that with the group of friends and then got work after that and enjoy the city so much and have been working on here since  how often do you go back to  probably at the most three times a year maybe twice using the holidays maybe one random trip in there  it&#39;s Ellie&#39;s only now just starting to come home to me in the sense of that respect or like I was going home was going home now going home. Going back to see my family and seeing some friends but I might by Fillmore I feel like I belong in Los Angeles I do back at home  things you really like about a leg  add food on the weather goes without saying I factory sources are like feeling I like that the things I want to do a much easier much more accessible here than they would be in North Carolina so it I feel like I&#39;m unable to Upper Sue heel of my passions Ambitions in a much more functional unrealistic way living Los Angeles than I am in North Carolina  I mean the cost of living is in great but soon come to I always tell people like part of the rent is having access to so much research so many resources out here so it&#39;s not even expensive is New York or Boston so I thought the worst but I also don&#39;t mean is a little bit annoying that every time I do want to go home and safe Lighting on the drive I can but mean really conceivably drive home for the holidays it&#39;s been 3 or 4 days and chair and just not practical so it&#39;s unfortunate so far away in that respect but geography  I studied history and media studies and production  yes I work as a freelance writer and producer  in college I realized I was pretty good at it and I knew there&#39;s way to monetize that and I came out here and worked a little bit in the public sector and trying to understand those jobs that way and realize I could make more money have more control over my schedule in my life if I did it for you and so I&#39;ve been doing it now for a little over a year now  great  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I do my love traveling guy try to go somewhere new for a good. Of time about every 7-Day months to try to make something so I was in Barcelona just recently and I&#39;m planning on going to either Vietnam or even back to Europe in a couple months up  awesome  show me about traveling  enjoy the break from routine I think that while it&#39;s nice to wake up and have a vague idea where your day is going after a few months you can get very much kind of caught at the menu pigeon hole is your thought process your expectations for today I love going to foreign country and just waking up and knowing that everything I do that day is going to be brand new and totally different than what I would be doing if I was in Los Angeles Earp and my run retain so I declare that I love food so it&#39;s great to just eat a lot of food I love in the places where they were originally created  yeah sure I went to Barcelona like I said a few months ago and that was mainly because I had a friend who was living there for 6-7 months and she kept asking to come out and I finally I was at the point work I&#39;ve been working so much for months on end I felt like I deserved a break so I went there for two weeks and he has won the healthiest smartest things I&#39;ve done in a while so I reminded me again how important this for me at least two out to travel it to get out of the world  I&#39;m very outgoing I love talking to people and conversing even virtual people I lost you  relax I listen play music a lot I like to read like to go see movies a cook I cook a lot so I enjoy cooking my girlfriend and I are currently separated by distance so I haven&#39;t seen her in weeks and that can be very sad and obviously so I&#39;ll talk with her as much as I can but I&#39;m a pretty simple taste  okay  yep I have lost her but I don&#39;t know if is a mix-up you have a direct response that&#39;s okay no problem  this is awkward isn&#39;t  I don&#39;t have much of a temper so very good I guess I don&#39;t really get angry easily or quickly and well when I do I&#39;m usually aware of it enough that I can kind of formulate how I feel and why I&#39;m doing that way and what I want to be done about it so so it&#39;s pretty pretty so pretty easy-going guy in that respect  nopon Sage probably something petty over like misremembering when  something was done or I get the date on something or like a fact I wasn&#39;t even emotionally filled and it was just about yeah I think it&#39;s probably about like trying to figure out when exactly we went to San Francisco and it was even argue as much as just the other person thinking the other person&#39;s message remembering self even Reno small or big situations very difficult for me to actually feel and rage by guess in the classical sense of the word  okay  tell me about a situation that you wish you would  true think I&#39;m not one one for regrets  how much recently did a project like a a film and the subject matter had a little to do with like an ex girlfriend of mine so when it came time to release it I made a point I can I don&#39;t want to send her directly so I want her to think that I was doing it to spite her face by did Center brother just because he enjoys my working I said I want to see stuff and I may be that she might have could have misconstrued as being passive aggressive I don&#39;t know but but yeah I mean that so bad I thought about that I don&#39;t really regret as much as like maybe I could have just let everyone else who wasn&#39;t so sure about if I should do stumble upon as opposed to me dragging it to them so just my thoughts are  tell me about the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make  it was actually probably probably that was even hard decision with Excel with that the same as score for the mission of us probably cuz I knew I had to break up with her after some stuff happened and is the focus I cared about her great deal but I&#39;ll send him to me it wasn&#39;t hard to rival the conclusion that I had to break up with her the same time to it was not the easiest thing to try to go through that process it&#39;s being on a roller coaster that you&#39;re very much aware of how terrible or frightening is going to be but you know you have to get on the roller coaster so that&#39;s probably a recent memory  Just Cabinets for reasons that I this person is probably not the best person for me so I said it was a it was I didn&#39;t have to I don&#39;t have to weigh too much too much data to figure it out it was pretty clear sign and have no regrets about doing it now I feel very strongly then about it I felt so I still feel very strongly that I made the right choice.  How easy is it for you to get a good night sleep I can beat it can be tough there will be I feel like it&#39;s either 5 if I&#39;ve exhausted myself during the day between work and the I buy started exercise has a huge help but but I&#39;d say that it&#39;s kind of when I get to bed and I never know how it&#39;s going to go sometimes it&#39;s sometimes I wake up within an hour of falling asleep and can&#39;t go back to sleep or Asia periodically keep getting up it up so it&#39;s something that&#39;s gotten a little better in the last few weeks but I am especially having my my current girlfriend not around because she&#39;s a very big source of comfort I also like that but she travels a lot for work so it&#39;s something to have to adjust to and asleep can be consumed as a person that but I&#39;m respecting that someone actually I feel like I don&#39;t eat too much sleep I if I can get find get four to six hours in pretty good shape that day so  how have you been feeling  anxious I guess more just dance just whenever I get off of the assignment there&#39;s always just a question like what am I what&#39;s going on necks and if I don&#39;t have the next project lined up so it&#39;s always that nervousness some in the past something usually does come up so we have the president of it usual working up until it dies you always a little anxious and depressed because it&#39;s like a you know I chose not very much a lifestyle that while I get that a lot of control and economy over my life it also is all on me in or do it again with sometimes I buy I&#39;m a very jealous of that if you&#39;ll just waking up going to the office for 8 hours leaving and not having to think about that work the minute they leave the office and kind of having the momentum of a group of people are our company carry them through when it&#39;s a little tough the words like me if I have an off-day if I&#39;m a sick day that no work gets stuck on you know I&#39;m a small business that has one employee  how do you cook  how do I cope with them I assume you mean I guess you could work without I cope with the May the better answer be how do I cope with that lifestyle just I got a much more he&#39;s doing something I&#39;m still learning and figure out how to how to handle as far as not just like I know what the other how rewarding work is when I do it with all Sophia what&#39;s the most efficient way to live the life you know how do I what&#39;s the appropriate way to budget finances what&#39;s the expectation I should have for myself in a given year Wentz realistic what&#39;s helpful and that&#39;s something that I&#39;m sure will take years and years to do but I feel like as long as I&#39;m getting better at it then it&#39;s progress rent  have you been diagnosed with depression yes definitely will once and then probably out if I would have gone back I was gone in high school probably live in second time but I feel like it&#39;s one of those things that is something I have to keep in check throughout my entire life you know how I feel like I&#39;m pretty happy person for the most part but has a as long as this bike is that what people are very creative or people do lots of the Mind attends the Fallen I get that to self esteem thing cuz it&#39;s so hard to feel so it was her so easy I supposed to get in your own head about that  this is within a year so I probably was feeling  awesome just haven&#39;t been there before I was kind of easy to figure out. You know it&#39;s going to happen again so I feeling the symptoms again  and going through those emotions and feel like okay at first I was kind of hoping to be some I could kind of working myself but I&#39;m I realize or just stupid for me to try to fight the Battle of my own so I went numb started seeing a therapist  really back this is my right just couldn&#39;t sleep at all I got to get maybe an hour of sleep at night at best on those sleeping at all had just no no no drive to do anything weather symbols brush my teeth or clean my apartment things like that and just being in the same time simultaneously being aware that&#39;s like oh this is all in my head inside even look at some of them so the general just a general malaise that comes with depression  I know I just finished up finished up I mean since I didn&#39;t graduate and like that but I got to a point where I felt like I kind of talked through as much as I could talk through and I moved on and another place my life is in a can of a good good work going to cash checks that I was working on something I really cared about now with someone I care about greatly and there&#39;s such a potential opportunity for me to do I have to worry about the symptoms and stuff as much now that I feel like therapy was not necessary also I just don&#39;t have the time to do with as much as work goes on some  oh I definitely I think having someone you can confide in who isn&#39;t your friend or family member who won&#39;t you know I have a few drinks and tell someone what you said to come early like that is definitely something I can&#39;t imagine how anyone couldn&#39;t benefit from having that on someone of a routine basis  I don&#39;t know I&#39;m I&#39;m coming from believer that all those things like those things are connected haunt you are also there for a reason like that my sister died when I was about 12 years old and she was younger than me and watching my parents like seeing my father cry for the first time was a very  trust traumatic thing for me and it felt like I grew up a lot that day so it&#39;s at my house so difficult to see that and see how my parents had to deal with losing a child I don&#39;t want to forget those things got the bitter Berry interval to how I cope with life and how I perceive hardships and obstacles and haven&#39;t got image of knowing my father on it&#39;s very very humanizing so easy to kind of  you idolize your pants on so I like my father but you know he&#39;s he&#39;s a guy like me and as I get older and some easily identify with the man he is  syberia 16 or 6  I kind of like the notion that there is a you wouldn&#39;t worry as much what people thought about you to realize how people how much people didn&#39;t think about you it&#39;s really hard to tell a 16 year old and I&#39;m at the point of telling a six-year-old but I&#39;m P I feel like a specially when you&#39;re high school until I get to nowadays you live in Los Angeles where so much is caught up in how people think about you and I still am very I find out someone is upset with me or doesn&#39;t like me a father&#39;s me to a great dealer I hate letting people down so I would like to come to help your place or just knowing this and I&#39;m just can&#39;t really control how people feel about you even if you have the best intentions in the world so  very compassionate guy on there for my friends I&#39;m pretty selfless in that respect I have a good humor about things we even with people with being depressed or depression I can joke about it something you know I&#39;m not a morbid to press mortise Theo I&#39;m aware of when I&#39;m I&#39;m low and I treated as such and I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t try to deny it or try to like and that&#39;s why I I have a I&#39;m a pretty practical person in that respect I don&#39;t think I even I&#39;m depressed I&#39;ll take it out on people or I don&#39;t think people feel told me they don&#39;t seem to mention that I&#39;ve been going through a depression know what you said and I for one feel like when I do go through so I don&#39;t have one can just tell and I&#39;m just a Smoking Gun of sadness basically but you know I stand to carry it pretty well enough I don&#39;t I don&#39;t lose sight of the reality of what I know is happening so  I was on my my girlfriend came she was in Thailand for 3 weeks and then she supposed to go to Spain for two but you can&#39;t sweat trip and came back and stay with me for about ten days and yeah I know I love her she&#39;s great she&#39;s the coolest person I know and so much fun and she when she&#39;s around makes me so happy and so having her for 10 days and we just had like normal we very rarely get normal couples time like it&#39;s always like oh I see for 5 days and then one of us has to go somewhere so they have 10 days is normal or we could just cook dinner at home like line bed and read books are like that was great. It makes me so happy that I have someone that I can do it within just feels so practical and Feel So Right  how your best friend describe you  you&#39;re so stressed about my mama I&#39;m a good guy like guy but I know I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t think I screw people over I don&#39;t I&#39;m a good friend to have I&#39;m I&#39;m there for people I look out for people I care about people and what they think of me and that goes especially much for my friends and I try to make sure you know it with a lot of my friends being on the East Coast I try to carve out time to make sure they know I think about them and I called him and so I feel like I feel like people who count me as their friend them probably one of the better ones since the sense that I I know how much I appreciate and respect the friendships we have  thanks Ali  strapped up

So I like to be like another applications editor  yeah  travel a lot  I&#39;d like to travel I&#39;ve tried before  one of those memorable experiences I  I&#39;m pretty close to my family back out here to be closer to them about 2 years ago from Chicago and so I&#39;m closer to them now, but I don&#39;t know it was kind of a mistake professionally cuz I haven&#39;t been able to get anything going out here and so I probably should have stayed in Chicago  I&#39;m sick and I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t really understand  I&#39;m pretty well Chicago it was fun over there was working as a grant writer and we&#39;re there for grad school but either dropping out of grad school but the finding work has been over 5 years I like it alot  Mallory situation I&#39;m okay with it right now I&#39;m living with a relative it&#39;s  it could be better but right now is like right now but employed and it&#39;s like I said anything to me stay rent-free and so I&#39;m okay right now before I&#39;m at but I really do need to find another job so I can  I get myself stabilized  yeah I&#39;m living with my uncle and  you know like I say at this place and so  he&#39;s kind of eccentric  I don&#39;t know how subscribe them he&#39;s pretty out there but anyway he&#39;s okay guy  do I have a source of what  I&#39;m sorry do I have  I can really barely hear what you&#39;re saying and it&#39;s hard for me to understand you sometimes but I&#39;ll wait for you to answer me or ask me a question  no I haven&#39;t  no I haven&#39;t but I&#39;ve  awesome felt oppressed  but I never had a diagnosis of depression  I&#39;ve been feeling good lately I mean relatively I mean  I prefer being unemployed and feeling like really angsty over that that&#39;s  you know I&#39;m in a position where I can you know you know I can&#39;t sort of like survive out here which is important and  and I&#39;m not homeless which is important so I feel okay I mean yeah I could be doing a lot better on the other hand I&#39;m not on the streets and things could be much worse  no I haven&#39;t  I&#39;m not sure what the question was if I&#39;d like to send some kind of therapy  I&#39;ve been in therapy before but it hasn&#39;t  I don&#39;t know I was supposed to be there people like the therapist and I wasn&#39;t like really  it didn&#39;t really help me out so much like a slight work at my issues but I enjoy talking to a therapist and I guess that&#39;s kind of like a pair of the whole situation to to the scenario talking to a virtual human that you just have someone to sit with for a while he will listen to you it someday I could be very soothing Melody  I feel that way often well do I feel like I need to talk to someone very often  sometimes I mean yeah I do like repressed emotions like man the pretty much I assumed I could ever become black holes with someone I would have someone I can share my thoughts and feelings with butts  I was like I guess you can say I do feel what&#39;s the word I feel lonely but not lonely but like for a self contained within  what&#39;s the word within my own sort of sense of self my own feelings and I don&#39;t really  have a need to reach out as much because  I&#39;m a practice God I practice meditation and I totally totally helps me like next to retreat into myself in lights are like fine fine serenity serenity through a lack of desire and soap that helps me with  I mean I guess I could loneliness but also I mean maybe it was like you know it like a problem I actually don&#39;t reach out to people as often as I should but I definitely neglected relationships because of that  and it may all be as like self-centeredness you know but  I&#39;m trying to oh yeah this is a good one I want to try to find a way to Lake engage with people without like really  allowing myself to let them down so to speak and so that is  one of the things that inhibits me from reaching out to people is the idea that I could that I could potentially let them down if they were to place their faith in me or the trust in me and so I&#39;m very reluctant to do that  go on  how easy it is for me I don&#39;t really again I&#39;m only hearing part part of what you&#39;re saying and so  this is going to throw off my answer  I would say it&#39;s very easy I mean I can&#39;t really like I don&#39;t understand the question for Quan  what I&#39;m I think I said it would only was afraid of probably most afraid of  oh my God being a failure or not being a success finding a stable job  not being able to  I mean settle down and essentially ain&#39;t getting married  it&#39;s um I don&#39;t know I am okay with being single I&#39;m not okay with being jobless  I&#39;m so it&#39;s like one of those things that&#39;s just like  I just I don&#39;t feel I can reach out to people so because I don&#39;t have a job and so I got to like bring them into my mic my life so right right now I&#39;m not in position to like a people I mean  they have a lot of friends with us because I can&#39;t like really go outside and they can so you know spend money at  and restaurants or in clubs or whatever  so I&#39;m going to buy to a lots and I think a lot so I meditate a lots and I read a lot of literature  I want to go to my felt really happy  well just last weekend that was set my  my aunt and uncle&#39;s 50th one of your anniversary and it was a nice occasion it was really it was not their whole family was there are friendly was there and  like my own parents 50th anniversary is coming up 50/50 years together and  I felt really happy for them I felt really happy that I got both of them and provided us with like a really  a really great childhood and  it seems strange I guess I put that kind of starting point but that&#39;s something I mean I guess like suit to be floundering right now but I feel happy for the  I think I guess locations like that are probably could become rarer on his light on a societal level but that some sort of like Beyond Leon sort of like Realm of happiness and anyway this weekend. I&#39;m on the road on a bicycle and going pretty fast  how are your best friends  my best friend  actually  she would describe me as depressed all the time and I asked her about this and he&#39;s like I swear if it being around me I had brought her down at all because she was going through her own like for a deep depression that I was kind of trying to coax her out of that but it sometimes myself and so  I asked her if you&#39;re around me brought her down at all and she said no it&#39;s it made her that I had liked it but I take an interest in her but  what&#39;s the word let&#39;s would like my sort of like my depression wasn&#39;t like really the net didn&#39;t have anything to do with her depression it was completely unrelated to like how I felt and feel like I don&#39;t know in both cases it was just good to have someone else to be around who had some respect for  like it&#39;s like how we felt or like alarm useful sort of like lack of feeling and I can put it that way and so has being brave I seem very depressed all the time and she&#39;s my best friend  at this moment  anything I regret  all right  thank you  goodbye  hello and goodbye  hello  it was kind of interesting as like I should have like told you I had like my ears are kind of kind of clogged and so I had trouble like during her at some at some point

yoga  much better I used to be with it when I was younger not so good lately I&#39;m actually very proud of it  I think the only time I really argue was on the phone with Time Warner Cable  I know it&#39;s been awhile  maybe not working hard enough some days  when your freelancer it&#39;s hard to keep at yourself to consistently be productive  well  I don&#39;t know  can we come back to that one I can&#39;t think right now  I probably  once when I moved back to Los Angeles from Boston  and  I had a girlfriend at the time and  it was hard to leave I knew I had had to come back but I think that particular move west was  what made you decide to do that  felt it was calling me  and that&#39;s where my connections were and I had to come home  I think so yes  erase for my memory  I don&#39;t know which I mean I don&#39;t know  something you feel guilty about  maybe you know  maybe doing something when your little  you&#39;ve had a couple of extra drinks and  you made out with a girl that you shouldn&#39;t have  it&#39;s pretty good  I think they&#39;re challenge there&#39;s my folks together got a sister sisters in New York not the Titus family but you know what I&#39;m grateful for everything that  I&#39;m derived from it  I have a best friend that I went to college with  and he&#39;s very smart I consistently call him when I&#39;m having challenges life challenges I will consistently call this well if you specific friend to get advice and I like that I have a couple of friends who have been tremendously influential in supportive friends ER  good friends are very important  how easy is it for  sometimes  most of the time  not horrible but not a may I mean it&#39;s okay  dragon type  not motivated or yeah  pretty good pretty good  no I mean there I think they&#39;re consistent with the way I&#39;ve been for a while  no  no  I think when I get consistent work when I get a lot of do a lot of creative stuff get a lot done creatively  I guess  I would hope something like  you know  charismatic  fun loyal guy  I wish I were more  more aggressive more consistent with  pursuing dreams I do a lot I do enough soon as I get down on myself for not trying harder to do all the artistic things I love to do  well recently  recently I signaled  into a lane this woman was shouting at me I could hear it cuz our windows were open was a hot summer day and then later  I drove up beside her and I said in a pleasant way I said I was just trying to signal to get into your lane and she was cursing at me through the window prior to that and she looked it up or just looked it up for finger gave me the finger and it was just  it&#39;s funny sometimes you try to approach someone in just a normal loving way and all they have for you is hate and that did make me feel bad  little angry  no cuz I took the high road  but she preferred Kretz I&#39;m sure  go out with friends make dinner recently a bunch of I had a small party at my house and one guy cooked food made a bunch of friends over and  that&#39;s always fun  let&#39;s see  never get to Upper to down Too Hot Donut Central at the highs and lows  because there&#39;s always a different it&#39;s a roller endless roller coaster so you need to be prepared for the for that long ride  creative things the creative the performances the comedic performances the  commercials I&#39;ve done that acting the stand up comedy the graphic design all my creative filmmaking all my creative Outlets that  better an expression of me  bye-bye  that was funny  there&#39;s a stove is the funniest point that just made me laugh when she goes you can prop
318 all right  okay  oh actually before that one thing I almost forgot to do something that stinks  are you okay  yes  I&#39;m all right  Los Angeles California  the lights big city it&#39;s always something going on  the traffic and that&#39;s it  business administration and business management  not that about something else I&#39;m doing networking at the moment  to open up a big clothing line and just Supply the whole world with clothing  yeah  definitely  I&#39;m all about myself it&#39;s all about me  not often but more times than not yeah  being lied to and I guess people think you&#39;re dumber than do anything with you are  try to get away from everything going to my own space  very well I&#39;m great at controlling my temper  probably like 2 days ago it was probably just over some sports it wasn&#39;t a real argument  not a lot but I travel enough  just being able to get a change of pace see somebody knows he new faces new environment  let me see the last trip I had was Vegas you know how Vegas cuz it was pretty fun it&#39;s a lot of a lot of drinking and a lot of partying going on  I&#39;m pretty open-minded I&#39;m kind pretty much everybody I&#39;m a pretty even-keel guy  it&#39;s all right it could be better  no  no ma&#39;am  nope  no  lately it&#39;s been pretty tough I guess cuz I&#39;ve been staying up so late but that&#39;s my fault  I don&#39;t know I guess I&#39;m a night owl all of a sudden I&#39;m turning into an hour  sluggish and tired all day if I don&#39;t sleep well all day I&#39;m just laying around  no not too much  give  stay focused and listen to the adults  yeah  self-explanatory I could have just listen to parents are other adults I tried to steer you in the right way and you know you&#39;re being a stubborn kid at that at those ages so it&#39;s like why do what are you talkin about I miss my life I can do what I want I don&#39;t have to listen to you but now I see that with every telling me was correct  how would your best friend describe  hilarious  are you to your family pretty close  both my parents mother and father  recently did I do a New Year&#39;s Eve party I had thought I had the time of my life it was so fun  I&#39;d love to hear all about  this New Year&#39;s Eve I went to a party at friend&#39;s house in Baldwin Hills area he had it at a pretty nice house it&#39;s a three-story house and it was like 350 people in there it was pretty fun but it was also not that fun because it was telling people and you couldn&#39;t really move so that was the only downfall of the size that I brought my new year in great with tons of friends and that&#39;s how supposed to be done  what are some things that usually put in  I&#39;m generally in a good mood every day I mean waking up with me in a good mood I guess you can say that but I don&#39;t know how good a good meal  one of my most memorable experiences are probably when I was younger I was in Boy Scouts and we should go camping all the time and one year we went to Yellowstone or Yosemite one of those places and we had to work on a mountain biking merit badge and of course made from the city I&#39;m like a mountain biking I can ride a mountain bike but once we got in the real mountains on got on real mountain bikes I gained a new respect for the mountain bikers it was pretty it was fun and pretty intense going downhill doing about 45 miles an hour and dirt on a bicycle was pretty intense and I was I&#39;ll never forget that  I don&#39;t know that&#39;s a tough one. What am I most proud of I don&#39;t know honestly
467 yeah I&#39;m okay with it  I feel pretty good little nervous  because I&#39;ve never done anything like this before that&#39;s why  from Ohio Cincinnati  two months ago two and a half months  I was just looking for  wanted to be in a new environment  oh yeah I&#39;m ecstatic  very happy  I took a few weeks just to get adjusted  cuz I don&#39;t know it  the weather is probably the best thing  yeah I know  been other than that pretty much the same as everywhere else I&#39;ve been  it&#39;s nothing I don&#39;t really like about la  since you know the weather is the best part of it  I like to travel somewhat I haven&#39;t travelled a lot of my life but over the past year-and-a-half I&#39;ve done done quite a bit of traveling  seeing different places different people new people new faces  new places  but she lasts will last summer I spent the summer in Cleveland doing the urban farming  in the city  I stayed at a hospital the first hospital in Cleveland  and I was at doing program with the  and it was basically we would go to different Urban Farms throughout the city and volunteer  about 20 25 hours a week  oh yeah  really a spur-of-the-moment type of thing  wanted to try something different something I&#39;ve never done before  and farming is one of those things that you know most people would never try  cuz of a you know cuz of a certain stigma that comes along with it  and you know I just thought it would be fun and interesting to do something like that  what in the urban farming or in general  Urban farming  how do I guess  I don&#39;t know just just the overall experience is going you know eating and going to the farmers markets and eating all the fresh food and just send the difference in  you know how fresh natural food tasted you know as opposed to the foodie by the grocery store  yeah it is really this  I was I took two semesters of a college and I was undecided so I was just taking General classes  my dream job  it&#39;s my dream job with the D  anything that involves I don&#39;t know how like a specific dream job or anything that involves nature just being outside I would like to I wouldn&#39;t mind being like a like a forest ranger or something like that  as long as I have you know yeah  consider myself more shy  don&#39;t like don&#39;t know why it&#39;s just the way it is  I read  listen to music  a draw  watch movies stuff like that  I think I&#39;m pretty good at it  I think yeah  wow  yeah I can&#39;t remember the last time I hear argument with someone  I don&#39;t know  again I don&#39;t know because  I don&#39;t  dwell on things that happened in the past  maybe whether or not to come to California I guess that was a hard decision  well  I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve been thinking about it you know moving to a new place for a long time  and I guess  hardest part of the decision was  thinking weather  whether or not I will be secure or not you know what I mean just going to a new place we don&#39;t know anyone  kind of  are you really don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen  so  there was a lot of  you know fear not in that decision should I go to a place where I don&#39;t know anyone I don&#39;t I&#39;m not familiar with the area you know only only perception of a hat that I have of this area&#39;s you know what I&#39;ve seen on it and media media and TV  so you know yeah I guess that was the hardest hardest decision that I can think of  I guess so  nothing absolutely nothing  yeah  nothing  I don&#39;t feel guilty about anything  relationship with my family  I&#39;m not really close to my family  I guess the person  I&#39;m closest to as my mom but you know I don&#39;t you know I never really talked to her much  I don&#39;t really know my dad that well so you know  guess my grandmother  yeah she yes she&#39;s  she&#39;s very  how should I say it  she&#39;s very to The Thinker I put it like that like she&#39;s very insightful so  you look so her  for a lot of advice because she&#39;s been through a lot through a lot in her life  I feel like she you know she&#39;s been through a lot so she understands a lot so let you know  she&#39;s a very positive influence  very easy  maybe unsure  I would say  because  right now I really don&#39;t know  what direction I want to go in with my life  and it&#39;s been a lot of confusion with that  but you know it&#39;s not  it&#39;s not something that overly affects me but you know it&#39;s always a thought in the back of my mind felt feels like somehow  maybe I&#39;m running out of time  I know that&#39;s not like that&#39;s not it that&#39;s not a realistic thought because  I don&#39;t see how you could ever run out of time but  yeah I guess yeah  just general not knowing what I want  but I know like how do I cope with that  how do I cope with that  I don&#39;t know I just do a lot of thinking a lot of soul-searching  it&#39;s not hard I mean I mean  it&#39;s like I can&#39;t say it&#39;s hard because it&#39;s one of those things that I feel like it&#39;s necessary  and  you know certain things in life you just you&#39;re forced to face  so it&#39;s harder to I think it&#39;s harder to avoid those type of things  no  no  no  today  when I talk when I talk to my friend earlier  awesome  how would my best friend describe me  I guess you would say I&#39;m quiet  if you describe me as a nice guy  insightful  Goofy  no I don&#39;t really think like that  no  10 or 20 years ago I guess I will tell myself to  stick with whip what stick with what I love  did a  acting Workshop  and numb  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve always been interested mine  and I decided why not no try it so you like it  what am I most proud of  like an event or an accomplishment  cuz I pride myself on being independent  bye
684 if that happened  why I&#39;m here  set up family room when she says goodbye  hi  I&#39;m not a  and please  are you okay with this yes  okay  so how are you doing today  overtired  where you from  diversity  the smog  you travel a lot  no  don&#39;t have transportation  going to Japan  scuba diving skydiving  welding  Rehabilitation for alcohol  okay  what&#39;s your dream job  astronautical engineer  do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing shy  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver  I meditate  when was the last time  I argued with my mom she left my  college certificates outside and they I got crumpled and damaged  and it kind of upset me  everything happens for a reason so I don&#39;t know if I handle anything differently  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  my failures  tell me about the hardest decision  I don&#39;t know cuz  I usually  or as of lately  call my heart  regardless  whether I want to or not moving off first instinct  it&#39;s kind of a mind over matter thing  I put myself in some pretty scary situations  but I&#39;ve just kept on going in and gotten out of it  tell me about nguy or something that you wish you could erase  nothing  yes  19  where to get away from home  are you happy  yes  did you ever see  no I was supposed to  I got the I got orders from Okinawa to go to cab unit which I was excited about and  they pulled me from that and they stuck me in a future combat systems unit non Deployable and it kind of upset me because I never considered myself a soldier because I never was able to deploy store now to quit for not having those stories of that camaraderie that other soldiers had with one another from having the experience of being overseas to Iraq or Afghanistan  still adjusting  I went to school and study welding  I don&#39;t really know  how have you been feeling lately  up and down today is coming down I had some bad dreams last night and some racing thoughts  I&#39;m kind of trying to  I feel like I see the signs from other people and for been more appreciative of me and I&#39;ve been more supportive of me you know going through everything and I really carrying and I feel like I&#39;m not pushing them away  but I feel like  there&#39;s there&#39;s a push and pull in a situation instead of allowing myself to fall into the situation I&#39;m I&#39;m pushing myself away from it and that&#39;s not a bad situation but it&#39;s  there&#39;s an under the uncertainty to it that I&#39;m feeling whether I am misconstrued about my thoughts and I don&#39;t even have that I can&#39;t even I don&#39;t even speak I don&#39;t need to say Hey cuz I feel that  I&#39;m wrong in that if I do it&#39;ll be embarrassed. Embarrassing moment but no change the entire situation or something so I don&#39;t want to cross that boundary  I just kind of  if if so  like right there in my face but yeah I&#39;m not looking at it  and it&#39;s frustrating  okay  have you noticed any changes in your behavior  not since  since yesterday I&#39;m pretty consistent  no it&#39;s been pretty consistent  I don&#39;t fall asleep I don&#39;t wake you up late  what are you like  crocodile sleep during the day  learn more depressed  a little more negative  not angry negative sorrow night not so not so negative  2 *  Hey Big Bird kind of negative  yeah  how long ago were  from the psychiatrist maybe a few weeks ago  I want to  Snappy  Ivan  I I turn it into jokes  arai tour  so I meditate I forgot that I&#39;ve been so sorry. Meditation again and  it&#39;s only been helping it&#39;s still doctors aren&#39;t really listening which is really frustrating especially since I&#39;m on medication and it&#39;s really messing with me because I&#39;m on I should be on different medication while I&#39;m on now the medication to have me on is messing with my mood  it&#39;s just it&#39;s a whole big mix-up and  I need to be more assertive  and I&#39;m trying to not be so aggressive and assertive but just to be with another hey this is what needs to happen  can you repeat the question  or, to seek help  well I was on as I was going through a spiritual journey and my mom didn&#39;t like it  you still got to say  yes  you feel therapy is useful  yeah highly  well  I&#39;m able to  I&#39;m able to  get more to the bottom of things I&#39;m able to understand myself a little bit better me to understand the issues of things better  really happy last time I felt really happy is  tonight that I stayed up for  last ate up without taking my meds and I danced I&#39;ve climbing trees  I was just I had a good 24 hours  real or not real  I don&#39;t know  tell me about something you did  yoga meditation  ride my bike  nothing  I think I&#39;ve asked  thanks for sharing your thoughts  Define  are ashy motion effective  what&#39;s lean  if I
301 yeah there&#39;s also on Craigslist so that&#39;s why okay  how are you doing today I&#39;m doing good thank you  I&#39;m from Los Angeles  I&#39;m great  I live in West Los Angeles the west side  it&#39;s all right  I live alone so  I love it I&#39;m from here so I grew up here it&#39;s natural  the weather on the weather  it&#39;s always good you never never bad there&#39;s always something to do really dull moment  traffic  the traffic is horrible I&#39;ll probably traffic is horrible in almost any major city but I hate the traffic  not really I mean I have enough things going on here so if I travel it&#39;s usually somewhere this within driving distance  I study business I didn&#39;t  no I&#39;ve been done for a few years so I haven&#39;t gone to school for a while one of these days I&#39;ll go back to graduate school but  my dream job would be to just work for myself and make some money  I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t really have a dream job just something that I can I can work under my own terms and get paid decently and being a creative creative environment  I don&#39;t know I think it&#39;s just a matter of finding the right situation so right now at its people are a little conservative about what they want so and how they wanted it so it&#39;s a little tougher than it should be but I don&#39;t know I think when the situation is right I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too difficult  yep  I work as an administrative assistant through a temp agency so  I just basically has to get sent out to do to do desk jobs  yes or no I mean I feel like I feel like I could do more but now it works so  I&#39;m pretty close there around so  I really mad  stupid people just basically doing doing anything to annoy me  that&#39;s because that&#39;s the big thing just irritating stupid people just do things just to provoke provoke me for no reason at all  what&#39;s a good example  this random people who think it&#39;s funny that just sit there and get a rise out of me just it doesn&#39;t have to be one any specific situation it&#39;s just people who just think it&#39;s funny that I think they&#39;re just generally sadistic and they just think it&#39;s funny to it just probably like it&#39;s like poking a stick and an angry dog knowing that they know how they just want to push your buttons for no reason so  I don&#39;t remember what those situations I usually try not to remember when it happens I just I just let it go and just like the past of the past I tend not to look back  what do you mean  okay  at what I do to relax I like to run I like to go to the gym  listen to music a lot of Musician&#39;s Friend so I just I&#39;m usually around musicians so anything of that sort I like I like everything from Lockhart to tattoos to just anything that&#39;s that&#39;s generally art and creative  who&#39;s been deposit  they just friends and general who received the we seem to do well and I think they are very inspiring and  which is sometimes a little bit tough and in a town like Los Angeles where I think everybody is on the go trying to accomplish their own goals so they don&#39;t it&#39;s sometimes hard to find someone who is going to be uplifting or try to be inspiring so  I don&#39;t really have anybody in particular but people kind of brought up things here and there  yeah it&#39;s like hey instead of instead of doing this how about doing that or egg you&#39;re good at this why aren&#39;t you doing that or something like that just now I&#39;m always looking for new opportunities so they always point out things that maybe I might I can do differently instead of just being negative thing hey don&#39;t do that that&#39;s no that&#39;s why you doing that it&#39;s a waste of time  I guess it depends on who you talk to  I&#39;m okay at it I can probably work at that I don&#39;t know I mean I can I think I can do better  go back to the point about people provoking me so I mean I try not to blow Steam and let them get under my skin so I just usually try not to let it get to me but I don&#39;t know I guess what temper is it depends on how I handle my stress lately I&#39;ve been better at it just because I think my situation has been a little bit better  now  now  no  nothing major and maybe when I was younger I could have traveled more I could have worked towards something that paid better job-wise but I mean those are all things that I think at any point in life you always think like why could have should have would have done but you know  but then again I think that&#39;s natural for anybody I mean I could I could have become a banker or I could have become a lawyer or doctor made. 10 times the money that I make now but but then again I don&#39;t like law and I don&#39;t like Madison so so it wasn&#39;t meant to be so  yeah  I think  I think my in my life I knew that there&#39;s a lot of things I have there&#39;s more things in life so I kind of narrowed it down to what am I good at and what am I not good at and what am I going to work well or who am I going to work well with and I not work well with so I kind of I kind of sort it out and then the list kind of  I&#39;m kind of answered itself so  no it&#39;s I don&#39;t think it was hard but it was just but I think it was a real reality check and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of a good thing cuz sometimes trying to conform to doing things that doesn&#39;t really fit you doesn&#39;t make sense it&#39;s like trying to shovel around peg into a square square hole and it&#39;s like it just no matter how you try to shove it in it&#39;s not going to go and so sometimes it just might as well go down a path that seems to work better for you  memorable experiences  I think it&#39;s just I don&#39;t really have like anyone in particular I think I think every day is almost like a memorable experience whether it&#39;s positive or negative I think it&#39;s just everything from getting it just the fact that  I got a job and I can I can take care of myself is already almost like a memorable experience maybe for the average person as it sounds stupid but you know I think just the fact that I&#39;m able I&#39;m able to get this far in life without completely self-destructing is already in accomplishments so I feel like  I gotten somewhere  maybe not tonight maybe not to the point to the average person they might think like well why aren&#39;t you a millionaire but you know what not everybody can be a millionaire  yeah  I want the last time I really felt happy  I don&#39;t know I&#39;m not really someone who is like  I don&#39;t have any real high highs or low lows I mean I haven&#39;t hit any Lowe&#39;s so I mean  I don&#39;t know I&#39;m usually pretty I feel like I&#39;m a level person and I&#39;m pretty everyday I feel like if I accomplish one thing that I&#39;m pretty happy so I guess the answer the question probably  probably yesterday I just feel like if I if I&#39;m able to accomplish something then then hey I&#39;m happy  no I don&#39;t really have a best friend but I mean well dance a question generally friends  I think they would say that I&#39;m very outgoing I&#39;m pretty determined  I&#39;m trying now I tried I try to interact as much as possible I&#39;m always out networking as much as possible so  I don&#39;t know I guess that&#39;s basically what I think they would describe me is  okay  no problem  all right  I was weird  play unplugged toaster
415 okay are you okay with this yes  I&#39;m good  Michigan  2 years ago  every 3 months  it&#39;s more homey and Country Than That Face insta  I work in the entertainment business so I had to be out here  it was pretty easy because I live in New York first and if you can survive New York you can survive la  things you really like  the weather of course beaches people are much router in me than what I&#39;m used to but I like it  a graphic design media arts  in High School I was ahead and all my classes and credits so I had to take a college course so while in high school I got a 2-year college degree doing it cuz I was good at it  yeah but now I want to go into something else  I&#39;m in school actually I take online classes now for business management  what&#39;s your dream job  I am really one day I want to own me and my sisters went on our own rental properties in like a real estate company we own fix houses now we bought with our College money and not we want to eventually when they own their own homes and apartment complex it  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  meeting new people seeing different things that you&#39;ve never seen before different languages everything to seeing what the world has to offer  oh okay me and my sisters went to Hawaii last year  am I believe we went to Honolulu and then tomorrow we here and we met the people in Hawaii and they were so nice if I can live there I would  everything was memorable but probably jet skiing in Honolulu was very fun  outgoing  music music is much Fairview for me  well my family is very musically inclined like my dad and my mom&#39;s family so music I&#39;ve always been like that thing no matter how I feel about her music on it makes it much better  so good to hear  I&#39;m pretty good I used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes I do that too I go into the gym and I do like a kickboxing class but I don&#39;t I never escalated to the point where I like to learn how older now I can control it pretty much  well I live with my sister so I argue everyday but it was over clothes my sisters and clothes always close  my mother and my father are pastors of the church I grew up with two sisters and older brother who was the cop  and we&#39;re pretty close I have a nephew we&#39;re pretty close like every day we see each other close and we don&#39;t all live in the same house but we&#39;re together every single day at some point when we lived in that when we lived in Michigan my family is in Michigan  when I cheat like right now I&#39;m on a diet with my sisters but last night I snuck and got McDonald so I feel bad because they&#39;ve been so sticking to it and I cheated but that&#39;s pretty good  me and mine with me and my friend of mine got into it and we said things that weren&#39;t like we hit below the belt that we and we usually don&#39;t and we haven&#39;t spoken in like 3 months now and I know that it could have been prevented if we would have just sit down and talk to each other but it didn&#39;t make it that far so yeah  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to me  probably moving here  moving to LA because  like I&#39;m I&#39;m really like what we&#39;re really close to our family like I Skype with my mom and dad everyday so it was hard to go from there to here and them taking care of everything to me and my sister do it on our own it was much different  oh my goodness I&#39;m parents my brother my dad my mom my sister&#39;s my family have a great family so my family definitely  2 years ago 3 years ago my brother was shot on duty  and he almost lost his life but he didn&#39;t and for some reason as much as I try I don&#39;t tell them this cuz I don&#39;t want them to be like I need to you know whatever but I always think about it over and over again and I&#39;ll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years ago just a mere fact of almost losing him Kinda Yeah  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep not easy I work as a personal assistant and administrative assistant for casting agent so I&#39;m on call for her whenever I&#39;m never I never get a good night sleep ever  enough  a zombie I&#39;m pretty much you would never know cuz when is work unprofessional so I am tired they never know but I&#39;m very

474 cool  all right  cool thanks  hi I&#39;m Ali thanks for coming in today  yes  I&#39;m good how are you  I was born in Hawaii but I grew up in Colorado  yeah yeah  how about some 7 to 8 years ago  I should go back once it once or twice a year  it&#39;s  how does it compare to La it&#39;s it&#39;s different it&#39;s not as busy there&#39;s more things to do outdoors in the mountains on my fan  for work  yeah I am I love it here  it took about a year before I really felt comfortable but once they got through that kind of hard year it was pretty good out here but a good time  I love that I can go to the beach I love that it&#39;s warm most of the time I love that I&#39;ve met a lot of people that love the Arts as much as I do  the traffic just like everyone else yeah  yeah this traffic and it&#39;s pretty much just traffic earthquakes  not as much as I&#39;d like  it&#39;s just nice to go someplace new experience something different  I want to hear that  I went to Alaska couple years ago and that was really awesome I got to go fishing in the ocean and I got seasick that was an awesome but it was cool I saw a bear in real life a bear walk through a yard is really different than La was way cool  English creative writing  well I always wanted to tell stories so it just made sense to work on riding and somehow some aspect  yeah I am  to have my own TV show where I write it and everyone watches it every week and it&#39;s awesome  really hard  cuz there&#39;s a lot of people that have the same dream so  yeah  more outgoing than shy  I like talking to people enjoy other people  take screensaver  go to the movies or turn on music dance  pretty good  I was at work couple about a month ago about a month ago I got mad at someone because I didn&#39;t think they were they were giving me clear instructions and so when I try to have a conversation about it they got mad and then I got mad and we got mad  I felt like I wasn&#39;t being heard or listen to and felt like we weren&#39;t able to have a real dialogue so because we couldn&#39;t have a dialogue I felt like no one was listening to me  totally  no ragrets  I yes  I don&#39;t know if there is one I mean I&#39;m sure there is but one time I was driving behind someone and they will they cut me off and I think it&#39;s just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago it&#39;s just one of those days where I just didn&#39;t want or I just been a frustrating day when this person cut me off and I almost got an accident with them I just followed them to their parking spot and actually I&#39;d haunted them and they they flipped me off and so she&#39;s really really going to my skin would cut me off and almost caused an accident and then and then flipped me off so I followed them to the spa and I asked said Miss why did you put me off when you cut me off and and she said oh you know I&#39;m I&#39;ve had a rough day I don&#39;t need your attitude and her daughter was with her and I told her well you&#39;re not releasing a very good example for your daughter and you know I didn&#39;t need to be Petty like that but I just I wanted to be a guess  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to  get you going deep is the hardest decision was coming out to my mom telling her I was gay I mean it wasn&#39;t hard cuz it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom is very conservative and she she had trouble accepting and it it took a while but when she did you know everything is better and I knew it would be but it was just hard in the moment to you know tell her something she don&#39;t want to hear  when I was little kid my  my grandfather found our dog run over in there on the road and he  and brought it in and buy them over as a kid just like seeing death like that really just threw me off and frighten me and I was just one of those moments but like I guess I wish I hadn&#39;t been there for it because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad and she was woman&#39;s I guess you need as a kid but I didn&#39;t really want to experience like losses like that in your face  our relationship and our family is pretty good we find out as close as most but we do know we was we don&#39;t talk often but we talked with love and we always love each other when we see each other  my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me to you know pursue my dreams and not to let little things get me down so glad I had her  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep usually it&#39;s easy sometimes it&#39;s not  wife in between jobs recently I start a new job next week but while I&#39;ve been off I haven&#39;t been working I tend to like my body wants to stay up later and later and later and I&#39;m trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like 2 or 3 and getting up at like 11 so I keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or 12:30 and I just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half and I should be I should I should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like 9 but  I want to stay up I guess  a little scatterbrained like today I&#39;m a little scatterbrained cuz I I tried to go to sleep early again and I ended up tossing and turning and  so scatterbrained  most of the had a lot of time on my hands like I don&#39;t usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because you don&#39;t know what to do with it when you&#39;re not working I guess but  yeah I think that&#39;s the question  I just thought maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with the the not working thing  no  a couple days ago when I got my new job I got hired  outgoing listening attentive fun loyal  Bank  help  I wish that I  I probably should have looked better I wish I had more hair up here losing a little bit if I wish I was a little skinnier this is girdles pretty tight and you know sometimes I wish I had more money but  nothing too drastic I&#39;m okay  yeah  hoo  when I was a little kid I was I was the fly was the fat kid and remember I was like I was going to high school and it was like the second day and I remember this guy came up to me and was like he was like pretty nice to me I thought midnight realize he&#39;d like this like out of a movie right here put Band-Aids on my back that&#39;s it like I&#39;m a fat cow until like like yeah like just a bunch of mean stuff and I didn&#39;t know I walked around with it for like half an hour people laughing I didn&#39;t get it and then find this girl is going to me and was like hey there&#39;s like Band-Aids on your back that&#39;s Kelly&#39;s mean things and then she just walked away she didn&#39;t like help me take them off and I remember like I couldn&#39;t get them I was trying to find him and then I just never liked putting my head in my locker and like I didn&#39;t want anyone to see me cry so I just like what made out of my locker and like pretend like I was looking at stuff my backpack but really I was going to know  the crying fat kid who can get the mean stickers off his back  anyting  probably  yeah  you know  I would I would try to keep trying to let myself know 2 to look at things positively and not like we would have people think about you and I spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me and as I got older I didn&#39;t care as much and I start enjoying life a lot more so  I went to Coachella it&#39;s a music festival it was 3 days with all of my friends and my boyfriend and we we danced and me went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time  oh I guess my MyCareer humble as it may be I really stuck in La a long time when it was when like it was hard I stay I stuck around it and quit so and I&#39;m proud that I&#39;ve managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in Hollywood  thanks for sharing  my pleasure  bye  bye  that was fun  okay
430 looks like we may have  okay  I will step out when she says goodbye  answer  fun fun thank you  I&#39;m from Los Angeles  well you can&#39;t beat the weather and I just think the familiarity of home just makes me feel comfortable here  smog rudeness although it doesn&#39;t compare to New York it&#39;s  people could be unbearable in their rude  not as much as I&#39;d like a lately I travel more in the past but not lately no  I just think between different places and some  learning new things funny things that are fascinating that piqued my interest  I think spoken to your cuz I think the first time I went to New York I was quite amazed I know it says still only in America but I just think I&#39;m being from La I didn&#39;t think anything or a city could be bigger and more how do you say ostentatious the New York but it was it was quite an experience and I didn&#39;t think any place was I  I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t think any place was dirtier than downtown LA I think times I think Times Square&#39;s got us beat  too many to mention I I don&#39;t even know where to start  depends on the situation  I like to walk I like to I like to play with my dogs reading anything where I guess I suppose I could just sit still and let my mind go blank I know reading requires some concentration but I noticed things that I don&#39;t have to exert myself too much help him relax  in the past I&#39;ve had problems but I&#39;m getting better  I probably are good my roommate  couple days ago but that happens we&#39;re friends loving argument if you will  I&#39;m at this roommate about six seven years ago we just kind of got moved around the same Social Circles and just got a loan  it&#39;s cool I mean it&#39;s the he no like we do argue we have our differences sometimes but there&#39;s not one person I&#39;d rather have I rather live with then then her she&#39;s she&#39;s cool  how much time do we have  is just too numerous to mention  my I would know how to answer that  I think breaking up with a girlfriend that I truly cared about but knowing  going bad just wasn&#39;t going to work  that was very difficult  just weigh pros and cons and just thought I just wasn&#39;t going to work no matter how much love or care I brought you a relationship there was something missing and I think that&#39;s enough time she invest enough timing  just knew it was over  no  so many I don&#39;t have too many regrets by things erased from your memory  a lot too numerous to mention I don&#39;t know how to answer that  the same girl that I broke up with shoes she was a girlfriend best friend of mine are they were separated for 4  several years and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you don&#39;t turn into a relationship and it hurt him currently we do not speak I wish I might regret is I wish I I would have handled that better  it&#39;s it&#39;s funny soon as I as I get older I&#39;m not as close but I still care for him and I still love them and I think they love me I my mother and my father both alive don&#39;t interact a lot very close to my older sister  my older sister  she&#39;s just strong

there was some I think I always knew before I got treatment that there was some issue emotionally and other things that are very hard to explain I just was tired of feeling that way so I thought I&#39;d help  I think just the letter g no desire to do anything motivation just wasn&#39;t there any normal person buy things up  so should I become socially awkward which was a little bit different for me because growing up I was quite talkative  I do  I&#39;m sorry figure  got you a it does I think it does  well  I think the number one thing on this is what I&#39;m amazed about the temper I think I&#39;ve it&#39;s allowed me to  two step back from certain situations not take them so seriously and not get so tense or angry and then react they could just calm down for the most part  now it&#39;s becoming it&#39;s becoming routine initially it was very difficult  well 5 years old  I don&#39;t know which one of your kid there is nothing really to  got to be sad about your kid  my best friend  but you were gone I would have a dry sense of humor so you know my best friend would probably  I think the the banner back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know fall in love  I

634 okay hold on what you said she should stay good but in French  friendship  okay  okay  yes  I&#39;m doing good thanks  I&#39;m from Los Angeles in California  I love the beach I love the weather and I love all there but things there are to do here  I don&#39;t like the smog I don&#39;t like the traffic and that might be those might be the thing at the top of my list  which have a little bit yes  we enjoy packing the kids up getting them in a different environment helping them to learn about different cultures and experiencing those cultures to the fullest and just getting away  a couple years ago we took the kids to Acapulco for Thanksgiving and it&#39;s not normally a time of the year that we travel but we thought we try something different and it was a great experience for them we did all kinds of things that we normally wouldn&#39;t would not have done so with an opportunity to sort of stretch our Horizons and experience some new things and we actually had a really great time  one of my most memorable experiences in terms of travel I guess was the time that my luggage got lost in front of Vallarta and I spent the week I&#39;m wearing my husband shorts and t-shirt  I went to a fashion  for two years and then after that I got my bachelor&#39;s  now I&#39;m a real estate agent that has nothing to do with the subject that I studied in college but it&#39;s as the great career nonetheless  my dream job would still be in real estate but it might be such that I have the financial means that I can just do it because I love it I love helping people secure their first properties I work with a lot of first-time buyers it&#39;s their way into wealth management I like educating people on the process I would probably still want to be in the business of real estate I might actually delve more into income property ownership but it would still be something in real estate  definitely more outgoing  I have a good relationship  I work out to relax usually three to five times a week I work out in the mornings and it does help to manage stress and in real estate and being a mom there is lots of stress in my life  getting better at it not the best at it I tend to be very outwardly with my emotions and I&#39;m learning to try to check them out the door a lot more than I used to so I can work in progress  it probably was the person was probably my husband and the timeframe may have been a month or so ago and quite honestly I don&#39;t remember what it was about so that I told you that it was probably something that was not even important  I wish that  I wish that I would argue with my husband less especially in front of our kids  I feel guilty about arguing with my husband in front of my kids is something that they should be apart from and separate from and not even not even be included in that  tell me about the hardest.  It was probably the decisions had let my daughter move forward with the heart surgery that the doctor says that she need it but it was it was a very scary time and place for us but we we move forward with it was a decision that I did not make a loan I made it along with my husband  an event that I wish I could erase from my memory would be  as an as a child being touched any of her inappropriately by a family member  no  I&#39;ve been feeling fine  I&#39;ve been feeling fine this summer the work stress is still there but my kids are out of school so our household is a lot more relaxed my son is actually in Sacramento for the past couple of weeks so it&#39;s just my husband and my daughter and I and we&#39;re sort of taking a little bit of a laid-back approach to Summer before our vacation comes up  have you noticed any changes  no  I&#39;m pretty easy over the last two to three weeks I think there was one night or I had so much on my mind I just find it hard to fall asleep but in general I do sleep well  what workouts help with that as well  I just sort of not as social a little more quiet  lag  ragging  no I have not  no  today or yesterday just the ability to be blessed to wake up every day and I have an opportunity to make the best day that I can  that&#39;s that&#39;s a blessing so I&#39;m happy about that every day  my mother is definitely a positive influence in my life she is someone that I go to and confidence all the time she&#39;s a very spiritual woman and always seems to lead me appointment in the right direction  my best friend actually passed away so I will I will use my husband who was a really good friend actually in at this point he is my best friend and he would probably describe me as someone who lives my life passionately who is very dedicated and loyal and who wears her emotions on her sleeve  on Saturday my husband my daughter and I just we were in Burbank handling some business and after that it was so hot and my daughter asked if we could go to Sherman Oaks Galleria to hang out and it was not something that was my choice but it was just really nice to be able to hang out and I really casual environment and do something that that she wanted to do and I really please her and we went shopping and we had a we had a really good time but ordinarily I would have never chose that activity but because my husband and I were able to throw whatever other plans we head out the window and just enjoy her and ended up being a nice family outing  nice  I&#39;m proud of my children I have a 7 year old daughter and a nine-year-old son and I&#39;m very proud of the way that they are are growing up and that their character and their academic skills and really that the little people that they have become  thank you  goodbye
451 okay thank you  and please  are you okay  yes  okay other than this laryngitis I have  a Cleveland Ohio  in 79 I think it was  once a year or something like that or less  there&#39;s a lot more to do here  they&#39;re a little more narrow-minded back there and Republican  well originally Show Business  but probably to get away from Cleveland  it was very difficult at first  I&#39;m not used to change I don&#39;t like change very much you know having to  meet new people and figure out how to make a living  well  I like the different opportunities you have the different the health Consciousness the movies  the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather  the driving the congestion some of the superficial attitude  the importance  well not a lot but I do I just came back from Vegas to visit relatives we met there and I&#39;m going to Mexico next month  well seeing the different cultures like I&#39;ve been to Europe Greece France Italy I like going to places such as Mexico or it&#39;s going to be sunny and just lying out I went to last year I went to Arizona and ever saw Sedona that was really  an experience peaceful  about Sedona  yep well Sedona is a very energetic place and I thought it was Desert like flat kind of desert looking but it was very Rocky and when you land in Flagstaff there&#39;s these beautiful pine trees and the elevation is high and then coming into the doughnut was very beautiful and and after a day the pain in my back went away that I had there for months so anyhow this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had the energy so is really very mystical  in life  or incident in life  well being on stage in Boston  and that was great I love doing that  just being with friends and laughing some of my highest moments when we were laughing hysterically  well  I don&#39;t know if a particular situation but when I when I decorate for special events and I worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and just laughing  and I can&#39;t think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but just being with somebody who&#39;s in tune with my sense of humor and gets my jokes and you know I get his and we&#39;re just enjoying that moment  speech and drama  I am a traitor  oh no not now  I always was interested in  musical comedy when I was a child I would sing along to records in my living room  and I was always inquires in school and then when I  went to HighSchool I join the drama club  and I just always had an interest and I always had a big personality and  well  I don&#39;t know if I have a dream job anymore I&#39;m 60 and  I don&#39;t know if I have aspirations anymore to towards doing anything right now I just rather not work in chest  relax and travel but  I like being creative and in any way I can I like Independence and I kind of have that right now so  I&#39;m okay  I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  well I I watched my favorite television shows that I&#39;ve recorded  and I also am a Buddhist I&#39;ve been a Buddhist for  gosh since 1988  and I&#39;m at District leader in my community and we have meetings and that really helps to Center me and bring out my higher self so if I get tense or nervous I I chant  sometimes okay sometimes not  a lot yes yes less and less though it&#39;s been happening less and less  but  yeah sometimes it&#39;s got its hit some created difficulties  well  I can&#39;t remember an argument I remember getting angry like was just when I was on my trip in Vegas I was driving and the GPS said stay in the left lane and I stayed in the left lane but when I get off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway about 4 miles out of our way and I just  I got very angry for about 30 seconds and then I had to call myself down and say okay alright so we&#39;re going to be late and I had to talk myself out of it so it wasn&#39;t really an argument with anybody but I felt kind of bad that I overreacted  you mean in my life many&#39;s yes  Ashley so many  I just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing information like they&#39;re not going to use me on a job or something that I would  take an attitude that  I&#39;ll find something better it&#39;s okay and move on as opposed to feeling what&#39;s wrong with me and you know did I do something wrong and then get angry at the Hammond  you know that  whole thought process that really doesn&#39;t help the situation  can I do that more often but I since I started chanting but it doesn&#39;t you know I&#39;m not always in my highlights get to where I can do that  I find a lot of situations to talk to me like you know what television to buy yours but  I guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences and  or leaving my comfort place if the decision meant that I had to leave my comfort place that would be a very difficult decision for me  and probably leaving a relationship  very hard because  it your I get dependent on that relationship so I usually live it out until  that&#39;s for it. It&#39;s believed or something and it&#39;s very hard for me to make that decision that this isn&#39;t right and I have to move on so what I usually do is I don&#39;t make the decision and I end up suffering with longer  cell  can we move on  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  well it&#39;s hard because I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s because I have pain in my back  and neck but it&#39;s difficult for me to stay asleep I I don&#39;t get it a deep sleep  but  because of it so it&#39;s hard to say because right now I have this cold and I&#39;ve had it for 2 weeks so I&#39;ve been taking Nyquil and that&#39;s been putting me to sleep so I have been sleeping better because of it but last night I had woke up coughing so it&#39;s it&#39;s hard to tell but before that all happened  I was  finding it difficult to stay asleep  and so therefore I&#39;m tired during the day and  sometimes I&#39;m groggy sometimes I&#39;m irritable  but I&#39;m not really sure if it&#39;s related to this pain in my back or emotional things are or are not  I&#39;m sorry could you repeat that  have I studied changes in my behavior  no  I was not  no  oh why I was like happy last week you know  can you tell me about the  well I  was going to Vegas to meet my family with my my family is flying in from Cleveland to there we have a relative in Vegas and I drove with my friend  and it was my brother-in-law 70th birthday so we all went and had a good time in Vegas and I was struggling through my cold but but it was fun it was nice  well  are they think I&#39;m funny they feel that I say it like it is  then they all say they understand me so people who don&#39;t understand me I think sometimes don&#39;t know how to take me cuz I&#39;ll I&#39;ll say something sometimes it come up come across sarcastic but that&#39;s just the way I talk  so  my the anger that sometimes Wells up in me you know I just but although that that really made me I think a lot of the person that I am you know all the all of your  experiences make you who you are and how you handle them  makes you who you are and if you don&#39;t have those Lowe&#39;s you don&#39;t really know what hyzaar  so I don&#39;t I can&#39;t really go back and regret and I wish certain things didn&#39;t happen whatever but really what matters is today and now and how you handled today and I wish that well I can&#39;t I don&#39;t wish I know that I will have less of these moments where I just burned out you know anger or something I just wish that would happen more or less that anger Parts what happened less and they are so  I guess it will  having less  don&#39;t give up hope live in the moment  and  everything will everything will work out everything will work out  and if you believe that then you really have nothing to fear  the fact that now and for the past 20 years 20 some years I&#39;ve been cultivating myself and I&#39;ve been I&#39;ve become a more  compassionate person  and I&#39;m able to  understand people better and see that you know they&#39;re they&#39;re suffering too and that if you if you treat people from that respect if they&#39;re they have their problems too and they&#39;re suffering with their problems to you able to live a better life because you&#39;re not allowing that to affect you if you&#39;re not taking it personally and at the same time you&#39;re becoming more compassionate person and when you&#39;re more compassionate you&#39;re you&#39;re happy and your life is happy  okay

455 glass is pretty fashionable  so just give her a couple seconds and then she&#39;ll start  okay  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  yes  very well  Ohio  finish school came out to start my life  not often now not really often  all because my parents have both passed away and so that&#39;s my reason for that was my reason for going home  prayer  I&#39;ve just really not a comparison you know this is warm and  sunny and that has four seasons so it&#39;s a very different environment  I it took a minute to get adjusted to the different culture but after I was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here  I love the weather I love the fact that I have the ocean and the mountains and so many things that I can choose from and the diversity that I find here  can to not have things that I don&#39;t like because where I am I know that I&#39;m finding myself there so and I like me so that means there&#39;s really nothing I don&#39;t like  yes I do  I love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between all types of people it&#39;s a very rich experience  which one to wear  I guess I&#39;m thinking about Egypt and the wonderful experiences that I have their as I go the people and the  warm and loving experience I have the knowledge I get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids excetera things like that  there are so many there really are but I can think of seeing a baby in a mosque which was just really pure and it really stay with me how similar we actually all our that&#39;s probably one of the things that I remember most from one of my very first trips are there and let&#39;s see just the interaction of the people food you know incredible I love the food to  nice  wow I study lots of different things that studied law I studied entertainment I studied Communications I&#39;ve studied whatever I want to quite a Renaissance woman  it&#39;s just always been my way to really explore all of the things that I enjoy keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive and just allows me to be able to  be fully developed as a human being being able to do that  I don&#39;t have a dream job per se what I do have is a desired or just be able to be free to do whatever it is that I choose on a daily basis so  probably more outgoing  well I start my day out there relax because I start my day with meditation and several other spiritual practices that I performed before I move around I get exercise so that I keep everything humming everything moving and then move forward from there  excellent. I don&#39;t really have one anymore  argued  cannot remember the last time that I actually had an argument  channel is about  I imagine the last time I argue about something probably might be related to money  situation I wish I had handled differently  you know I try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to Hope guilt about the way anything went because they&#39;re all for me very positive learning experiences that I get to explore who I am through so I don&#39;t really see them as needing them to be different I need to learn from them or to just really accept what is  hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make  don&#39;t really have a hard decision you know because I grew up and away where my mother was extremely wonderful and the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say it&#39;s your life and so for me this is don&#39;t really come as difficult to make they&#39;re pretty easy to make because I&#39;ve been making them since childhood  I don&#39;t really have a most difficult decision I&#39;ve ever made  event that I could erase from my memory I don&#39;t really have one that I can think of that would be so terrible that I would need to  erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there&#39;s nothing really to regret or erase  how is your day  a very easy soon as I hit the pillow I&#39;m out  great a little more  Physical exertion then normal but still great  no not overall but again I attributed that knife credit that to the spiritual practices that I perform on a daily basis they keep me pretty even-tempered  no  no  that&#39;s pretty much every day I feel really happy everyday I&#39;m thankful I&#39;m grateful for my life and I&#39;m just thankful for everything that comes into  very smart very loving very intelligent  funny outgoing  I probably probably what my friends would say  there&#39;s really nothing that I think I need to do to do or to have her to be different about myself like I&#39;m okay with everything the way it is really am  what advice would have given myself 10 or 20 years ago to know  to understand that everything that happened 10 or 20 years ago was important in terms of developing the person that I am now and  so to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up  recently really enjoyed  I cooked a very wonderful meal cuz I love cooking  something I really enjoy  wow my my willingness to get to know myself through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application of everything that I learned about people cultures places and most importantly you know the God within me  bye  she breathes I see

434 yes I am  I&#39;m doing very good today  I&#39;m originally from Chicago Illinois moved out here when I was three  yes  I never go back  family issues  it depends on what you&#39;re into if you&#39;re into  the fast life and Hollywood it doesn&#39;t compare at all if you&#39;re into the cold weather than you would rather be out there I like the sun  my mom and my dad split up  it&#39;s okay  I have no idea I was only three when I moved out here  I like the sunshine I like the weather I like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter  fall and end in the summer I like the beaches I like Hollywood I like that the Lakers are here and I love the people is is a different variety I think La is a microcosm of the United States people from all over the world come to the United States and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to La for a better opportunity so that&#39;s why I like about la  no gang violence  no not really I travel one time to Arizona and one time the Stockton California and another time to Barstow California but I don&#39;t do much traveling right now because of finances  study alcohol and drug counseling  I just filled it in my I just got into my heart that that&#39;s who I was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addiction so  that was kind of easy choice I got some advice from people and I just went into it to do it just just to see what it was and finish school  it internship and got hired and so  I believe that&#39;s what I&#39;m supposed to be doing with my life  I&#39;m not working right now I actually moved away and  I had to  I was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so I actually had to give up that job in order to make that move but since I came back down I&#39;ve been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interview so I can get back into counseling  well  it can be it can be very difficult at times because  I have a felony and and so I can&#39;t work with you and I can work with the elderly and but the regular dose I can and then you have to be certified and I&#39;m not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even like you to take the test you after work a certain amount of hours so right now I&#39;m just trying to get into interns you know try to intern and show people what I can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen them my resume and  yeah they just want people to be certified not being certified the experience and the fact that I have a felony makes it hard  and my dream job is to open my own facility  or as an author  you know that the that depends on on on people mainly I mainly adapt my personality to the people that I&#39;m around if people are perky that I&#39;m going to be perky if they&#39;re standoffish then I may seem shy but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m just giving them their space and allowing them to decide when they want to open up but if people open up right away then I open up right away  I mean listen to music or  I watch YouTube write poetry  I&#39;ll just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like I could sing which I can&#39;t so that&#39;s  and nothing I do is I eat ice cream  controlling my temper I&#39;m very very good at it it depends on what it is I have to say that last time I lost my temper because I felt like somebody was  scaring my mother so I lost my temper but ninety-nine times out of hundred  I don&#39;t lose my temper don&#39;t like to raise my voice and I just like to be calm and cool and I like everybody to be comfortable I don&#39;t want anybody be frightened or anything there&#39;s no reason for anybody be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it I just believe that and I believe angry outbursts to be a link to  heart problems and high blood pressure so I definitely don&#39;t want that  well I was just telling you about it was it was my mother&#39;s husband and  tell you the truth I could have handled that differently but when I seen the look in my momma&#39;s eyes of fear I just lost it and I snapped you know I told my mother like I don&#39;t like this you need to take care of this because I&#39;m don&#39;t know how long I can keep my composure as far as this cuz I&#39;ve been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that&#39;s her husband and so I kept my distance in a relationship but when I saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me  dad  I don&#39;t like very much because I know if I get angry I usually stay angry for a long time so I should have just left  I should have just left and went home and rested and got up the next morning with the church but yeah we had a big Time Explosion and they had created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those 6 9 months I can&#39;t get back  yes  well my brother in prison I haven&#39;t seen him in 20 years he&#39;s been there 20 years my sister move to Chicago  13 years ago I haven&#39;t seen her since then so I&#39;m only close to my mother and my son I haven&#39;t seen him in 5 years and I&#39;m still looking for him and waiting for the day I see him again and how that&#39;s going to turn out for me I just you know I have small family and  I have family in Chicago but  I don&#39;t mess around with that side of the family just just because of what I seen and heard so I just don&#39;t want it to happen to me at all so I just keep my distance  has been a positive influence in my life I would say  taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else and talked taught me how how to like monitor my emotions in monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they&#39;re really strong that&#39;s when I just need to be quiet until that intense spelling subsides and then I can speak rationally and not just emotionally and of course he&#39;s he was the one that told me that I should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor he&#39;s got 27 years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that I&#39;ll never forget  feel guilty about my grandfather  pass away in 2004  and at that time I was just getting out of prison  2002 I was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he  told me in so many words that he wasn&#39;t going to be around for that much longer but I didn&#39;t get it cuz I had a lot of drugs and alcohol my life at the time and my life is crowded with things that I consider to be more important than that plus the fact I didn&#39;t understand him what he was saying but  when he died  I figured out that he was telling me that I should probably spend more time with him before it&#39;s time for him to go but I couldn&#39;t see it then and  I feel  I think about it all the time  erased from my memory  will be the date  my brother hit my mom I always Replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it&#39;s like  that&#39;s what Memories I can just go without replaying my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there  I feel conflicting feelings  because I want hand  on way hey my brother was protecting me  from getting beat  and on the other hand he was his my mom  so  time in the middle  most nights I don&#39;t know  I go to sleep maybe 3 in the morning and I&#39;m proud I&#39;m more than likely up at 7 in the morning so I don&#39;t get much sleep  it depends it depends on the environment I mean if I don&#39;t sleep well  I&#39;m going eventually I&#39;m going to be here to boo but doesn&#39;t happen right away it depends on my environment and who&#39;s around me if they&#39;re difficult people that&#39;s going to be a challenge for me and if people are easy going and no one would even know that I didn&#39;t get much sleep  I&#39;ve been feeling lately I just been feeling like  Dad  things are about to start going better for me maybe some better decisions taken advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can open the right doors for me so I&#39;m very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn&#39;t happen I&#39;ll send out a million resumes I don&#39;t care if I get 5 interviews I&#39;ve I&#39;ve never stopped because I know know that been a counselor is my life mission and and I&#39;m also destined to be a writer and it&#39;s just a matter of time before my book is out there and people know about me because I found a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and I have a lot to offer Humanity so it&#39;s just a matter of time before  that the public is exposed to what I&#39;ve been Gathering  my behavior I&#39;m more mellow I laughed more more humorous  I let a lot of things go that I used to just  let take me off and anger me and things that I can&#39;t control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don&#39;t betray me and you just can&#39;t control that I think I matured mentally and psychologically and and the acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me so  I know my thoughts of change and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed I still have to monitor it my thoughts and my behavior I still have to monitor them but overall you know  back then I just tolerating myself now I  actually like myself and it will boo boo hoo you to feel the same way  no no I haven&#39;t  no  last time I feel happy was last night cuz the Lakers won the basketball game  my best friend was described me he calls me the truth  because I always tell the truth and people tried to hide stuff and I always refill it they can&#39;t hide it from me I have a statement that says I see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and I see stuff days and months before they start happening I no human behavior when I see it and I sniff it out real well and it&#39;s just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth because of how I interact with people and how people have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that I see through them like I said like a clear glass with nothing in it and yes that&#39;s why he calls me the truth  I wish I would have never  well obviously I wish I would have never went to prison  I wish  Falcon change well  my economic status my employment status  my teeth that&#39;s like a problem area for me I did a lot of stupid things years ago and it caught up with me and I didn&#39;t take care of my teeth and now that I need to be  confident about myself as I can be you know it always comes up every now and then you know the thought like I wonder if they look when they&#39;re to look in that might if I never get the I never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there she starts that says  are they looking at my teeth so I will really change that and I will change my physical size I think I would like to be at least 35 pounds heavier but I&#39;m working on it  20 years ago which would make me 18  I would have at that time I was a big-time high school basketball player for Fremont High School and I had college is coming to see me and I would have given myself the opportunity was the to stay away from the troublemakers because I didn&#39;t and I blew my opportunity to play college basketball for Duke Blue Devils and who knows I could have been playing for the Lakers last night but hey  I&#39;m most proud of the fact that  you know what I&#39;m most proud of my mom  really  really she graduated from school  she got a full-time job she got a full-time job she would wake up at  5 in the morning go to work get off her job at 3:30 go straight to the college lead to college at 9 at night she does this 5 days a week and still had the strength to maintain of she was on the Dean&#39;s List and President&#39;s List so doing all of this you know when they say that older people can do things I just think that&#39;s dispels that rumor  and she recently got her license as a evangelist in the church so I&#39;m just real proud of that and  her life is been affecting people in a positive way so yeah Mama  okay thank you  goodbye  okay

364 therapy like this instead of fun  with a live Human to put all the NFL teams out of business  because Provost  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good sometimes I think people might talk to a stranger better or more open than to  if it&#39;s someone that might just go buy a couple questions might judge you or for opinions of it&#39;s a virtual human being in might be a little less biased also  and nothing&#39;s great idea  we could sit at home and do this instead of a going into an office  now she is  that she can have it  thank you very much  how do I know what does she going to say the end of session or okay  I&#39;m a sheep but also I&#39;m going to actually have to go grab a tissue  oh I&#39;m sorry  not at all  sorry about that  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  creative  I&#39;m not a therapist  are you okay with this p.m.  I feel pretty good I&#39;m wide awake I had any good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and I have an easy day today so I am just going to chat with you then I&#39;m going to the gym and run some errands so I plan on having a nice day today  originally  I was born and raised in Los Angeles and I&#39;m one of the few locals from around here and I went to school away and but I&#39;m one of the few days that are actually in Los Angeles  yes I am  I like the weather having a vacation house in another state that I found to be too hot and humid in Florida I love the weather here I like the cultural diversity I like the familiarity I like that beaches Basswood like the chest an hour and a half away one can go to the desert Palm Springs Palm Desert but also another hour and a half two hours away and go to Arrowhead or Big Bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and I think it&#39;s a great place to live  well maybe some of the things I don&#39;t like that I like your say California in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to 13 points something out which is going to Chase business out of here also the regulations I&#39;m a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have been their businesses to taxes Arizona Nevada excetera some the other western states that are less regulated and that&#39;s a good problem here and California  it really does muscle don&#39;t understand it but it&#39;s also  yeah besides the high taxes you know there&#39;s a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don&#39;t see that but it&#39;s a big tax on the social service system and that&#39;s what make our taxes so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of  so that&#39;s how you know but people don&#39;t seem to want to really deal with do you want that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that&#39;s why our taxes are so high in people are moving out of state  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot I enjoy traveling got into 66 countries  and I don&#39;t travel as much as I used to but I&#39;ve traveled quite a bit and I just learned a couple of languages and I surf I&#39;m sorry  I didn&#39;t really understand that your question  when you said like what I don&#39;t think you understood what I said but I&#39;ll just go back and  I&#39;ve been all through Europe Eastern Europe Asia South America North Africa and I enjoy that and I enjoy the warm climates now especially where you can go and relax where is warm water to surf the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and I also like to exercise Surf and do yoga and workout and I try to eat healthy and that&#39;s a big part of my life  I love to hear  what are my favorite trips of all time where they used to when I was younger see how many countries I can do in a relatively short. Of time saying it three or four weeks span but about 10 years ago we actually went to Paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though I&#39;ve been there about 10 times we got to know the city really well which was great really live like a local and rent a small flat cooked and did our own shopping but really haven&#39;t been there so many times it really never stayed for more than 3 or 4 days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and I really get to learn the city and it was fun even though I grew up in La I grew up taking French which there wasn&#39;t a big Spanish speaking population when I when I was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take French in the Spanish would have been a lot more valuable but I took French all through elementary junior high  Tienda high school so it&#39;s nice to practice my French even though I don&#39;t remember a whole lot and even though it&#39;s Dad speaking French with the French you know my accent isn&#39;t the greatest ever a couple of sentences they start talking English to me  so that was out  I have a few different degrees  so I was a naval science major as an undergraduate  and that was fun and I also have a master&#39;s degree in economics  and I&#39;ve degree in crisis management  I found them interesting and  just something that I wanted to do where I went to college I went to the Naval Academy I&#39;m up there to play sports and I found it real interesting being from Southern California going to school on Maryland and I originally want to be a doctor but  which start going to school for a little bit you change your mind excetera so  are you still working  I&#39;m actually in the wholesale business now or Wholesale Distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but I went to work there a number of years ago when am I grandfathered recently father passed away so I was going to run up a tirol family business and it&#39;s pretty interesting I like it having grown up around it but different other jobs out of the past  actually probably my dream job I enjoy cooking and staying at home and  I would probably like to stay home and raise kids because I do have one daughter and you didn&#39;t get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as I would have liked but I think I would be better than say a lot of women I know that want to work I actually like cooking and hanging out around the house and taking care of kids you know that I like doing it always on a part-time basis but it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and not do that having pretty much worked for most of my life so I&#39;ll probably never happen but it sounds something that to me it would be fun  do you consider yourself more shy  I think I am generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when I get to know someone or feel comfortable I think I&#39;m more of an extrovert More Strangers might think I&#39;m more introverted but I think when I feel comfortable with certain people and I don&#39;t know what it is I can meet a stranger and be totally confident or people I might have known for years either from a personal or business situation  and be more introverted I just go with the Dynamics but I think my outward manifestations to be a little more shy generally and he&#39;s like use the term reserved  okay  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  oh wow that&#39;s a great idea I used to have that on one of my guy with several computers at home and I bet you speak one of my screen savers as well when I need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events exercise will there be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or Tony the beach yeah maybe going surfing of the weather is warm I don&#39;t start from cold weather anymore cuz it makes  because Mike a brain freeze you not surf you know if over 30 years and exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the TV I find relaxing  I like that screensaver I used to have that on one of my screensavers at home  that was that was it but it&#39;s one of the things that took me a number of years to master that were my relaxation skills apart and have them the best of my twenties but over the years I think I&#39;ve gotten better  I think that&#39;s a key thing I think as we mature as we learn how to do that I wish I don&#39;t have to do that and be a little more hadn&#39;t had those skills earlier  I like to think I&#39;m pretty good I think I&#39;m a lot better as well as that as I&#39;ve aged you know I I am more likely to think before I speak now whereas a 20 years ago is more likely act before I thought so my dad said more things that I would ever attend situation where their personal or a work situation but I&#39;ve never had a violent temper but I would have a temper where fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and really reflecting on it I think I&#39;m a lot better at that now that I was saying my teens or twenties  I think a lot of that comes out here or there is maturity  oh wow you know I really had an argument with anybody in Somali what I would consider it traditional  argument probably my ex-wife a number of years ago. We had an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn&#39;t anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we weren&#39;t married our values are so different just our ideas of parenting and just  outlook on life was so different nothing that cost us the butt heads but it&#39;s just I know if I caught an argument but it was more of just one of those let&#39;s agree to disagree but heads some  I felt like I was talking to a wall and I actually felt more mad at myself that I should have learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone else folder with them that&#39;s the kind of discussions that people usually have but you&#39;re not really thinking about that because sometimes or younger work looking at boy how does that I look great on paper to her and she look great on paper to me I&#39;m pretty easy-going I have different ideas on raising children have she did and it was more not that she was wrong and I was right not that I was right she was wrong it&#39;s just how we raise our different views and we never really  discuss those things but it was really just fundamental reasons on why we butted heads weren&#39;t really a good match whereas other things look good on paper to both of us  tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle differ  find recently my father passed away recently  thank you and  really because in our religion you plan a funeral very quickly United typically within a couple of days and I really only invited very very close friends and family members has more or less sort of in charge of it my dad is were married but it was sort of not really up to it so I took care of it and I wish I had invited a  I kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would have liked to have come to the service and been known about it so I really know he invited because just before the time pressure really just a handful of people but now it&#39;s times past I wish I invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you have 10 or 20 points is of people he knew you from business or over the years and I really just an even distant family members I really just told after the fact I really didn&#39;t invite him this I was under a time pressure but I could have easily have done it via email or turn to call everybody personally but I wish that some things people have expressed a little  they&#39;re upset with me one my other family members through it all back at me all you can tell me till after the fact that you know someone serve it passed so they all through the media so I was more or less  doing this I wish I did that differently but I did the best I could at the time so I&#39;m not really mad at myself that&#39;s something I probably should have been more prepared for all service it was something that was coming was inevitable so  my boss my parents are recently  deceased in the last couple of years and had a brother that I&#39;ve three are brothers one of who passed away in December  and we&#39;re not super close like I always like I look at other families we were just never liked that Norman Rockwell painting because we&#39;re all so different and I have a closer relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it&#39;s strange but I wish it was more like boy one of those families I got together every Sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we&#39;re all also a different  I understand. That&#39;s just how it is but you know the strangers most of us how to use family everybody&#39;s great you know but I think every family has their own sort of  nope I thought probably I could have had it before from  some other events in my life and I just wasn&#39;t sure I&#39;ve had been to some therapy in the past just from  you know I was in the military and I was never really sure if that that&#39;s exactly what it was but I think I function  pretty well but I just wasn&#39;t sure that I had been nesin therapy and counseling over the years  I should decide to enlist in the military didn&#39;t enlist as an officer  I want one of the service academies  17 I started after high school and went to a service Academy  so it&#39;s more Prestige this isn&#39;t enlisting it&#39;s the hardware I want to sell her to school in America to get into  I was but same age as everybody else and went there  did you ever see KO  we did  1983  just basically wasn&#39;t anything intense was just weird just around since we were just we weren&#39;t allowed to carry ammunition we were just our positions were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us  so that was a I was at wasn&#39;t anything too too intense with lot you know he just fits the service I was in the training is way more intense in any actual combat situation  that&#39;s because they train you will like you practice harder than you play ignorant ass like he play football practice harder than you actually playing the game the same with  you know if you&#39;re in a combat unit  all right baby more patriotic having grown up  in California where people were from all over the country and I got to meet us most of see my friends who grew up in an affluent Los Angeles like I did never really went out and met a lot of American some people from different backgrounds and ended up becoming  just more patriotic a deeper sense of pride in the country what is really don&#39;t grow for that in Southern California where someone in Texas or Kentucky or Tennessee or Georgia North Dakota South Dakota Montana  it was up with that kind of Pride so I thought it was getting and unlike somebody my friends that they don&#39;t know what he&#39;s there&#39;s any life between Malibu and Manhattan  I went to graduate I was still in the reserves but I went to graduate school  and I got to graduate degrees and I&#39;m at work in private Enterprise didn&#39;t care for it that I join the fire department As A Firefighter and paramedic for a number of years and  then after I got divorced it was hard to do the custody situation with my daughter so into work in the family business that&#39;s pretty much my career in a nutshell  at first it was difficult because I just had such a bearing in my butt from the way I walked I talked and I guess I was an officer you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder to be a while to be able to come back to Los Angeles  I guess I was just so so different I think I handled better than most I have a stronger personality  so but it&#39;s a great experience  it all depends if I exercise regularly and I don&#39;t eat too late and things are going well in my life I generally sleep pretty well  even though I might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night now but I generally sleep do I sleep pretty well  I feel pretty good lately you know I&#39;ve been like anybody else more periods of blowing your life but the last few months I feel great pretty much  no not really I seem like I seem a little happier and more content lately  okay  have you been diagnosed with depression I thought maybe in the past said you have a family history of it and you know it wasn&#39;t anything real to debilitating and I wasn&#39;t able to really function on my own but I was concerned with it and sought counseling  I do I was really against in the past and until after I went and then I wish I went more save during my  my marriage or the course of my life now I think it&#39;s very useful however in the past I was one of those I grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money excetera but I think it&#39;s a useful tool that you&#39;re open to it  it&#39;s just a question. I want to just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it&#39;s good talking things out with a professional even though I wouldn&#39;t see somebody like you and realize I&#39;d prefer some of his older than I am a little more life experience and some of his may be younger  so but yeah I think it&#39;s a useful tool and I really did a 180 switch on that  I don&#39;t know now I&#39;m started taking a break from it but I&#39;m not against it if I have some issues I want to bounce off I give someone that I can go to  I think it&#39;s nice you know they really if you got to someone who&#39;s good and it could have been that few different people at start a therapist shot they really don&#39;t tell you what to think which I think it&#39;s great you know that&#39;s the passage to help you talk through your your thoughts  and you&#39;re feeling to let you decide yourself but bring a little Clarity to the situation that&#39;s why I like  talking to someone with a lot more life experience  and I generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff to take to a man  so but it&#39;s  I think it&#39;s a useful tool I got some good ideas and was able to slice bouncing some things off totally some of these unbiased is not in your day-to-day life instead of talking to a romantic partner or close friends whenever you but sometimes bouncing the people off of stranger is good  last time you felt really high  all this morning I know this this is weird them clearly someone and I&#39;d say this is a joke to my friends and family and Associates it clearly haven&#39;t having an easy day today cuz I knew we had a nice weather and I have much of errands to run and I clearly have seasonal affective disorder but I woke up so happy today when I know it&#39;s going to be 80 degrees out and when the weather is nice I&#39;m generally a lot more happier than when the weather is dark and blue and rainy and called where I always I know that time so but I&#39;m just what I woke up really happy today but then it&#39;s going to be a nice day  I look forward to feeling the Sun so  most of my friends I&#39;m sort of a renaissance man I know a little bit about a lot of subjects I&#39;m too smart for my own good  and I&#39;m off  I know a lot a lot a lot a lot of pretty things I&#39;m pretty rational I&#39;m very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and I&#39;ll talk them through it or resource won&#39;t tell them where to go whether it&#39;s where to buy a new computer or buy new car or  you know I&#39;m great with medical diagnosis  and people say I&#39;m a lot of fun and fun to be with and  I also have I don&#39;t have a lot of Grey areas people either really like me or don&#39;t like me to meet the things are pretty much black and white  I am what I am I don&#39;t BS  yeah I&#39;m the opposite of a politician  I don&#39;t tell people what they want to hear to be rude not read anybody but call things as I see him that&#39;s pretty much  really said you everything tactfully  okay I like to think I do  I wish Ice Bobby spent more time with my parents before they passed but it&#39;s busy I probably wish I was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was young  but just one of the three typical  really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or pretended to be more impulsive when I was younger than I am now  I think that&#39;s that&#39;s it and it would look at things in the long-term instead of looking and things in the short-term you make decisions or choices  what are you most proud of in your life  I&#39;m proud of my daughter she&#39;s nice young lady I am proud of my public service I&#39;ve never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service there very few people like me who did it or is that the background and education that I did but I like public service  and some proud of all that I&#39;m proud of all the certificates I have hanging on my walls and how many degrees it&#39;s sort of like trophies I&#39;m proud that they be able to stay in really good physical shape over the years and  knock would maintain good health  it was nice meeting you  bye-bye thank you  how was I  what does old-fashioned you know like Mom
470 okay  chat look like straight up there or are look at the screen  okay  okay alright okay thank you  yes  I&#39;m doing okay  I&#39;m from Los Angeles California  the food the weather in the people  I don&#39;t know it&#39;s not too many things I really don&#39;t like about La maybe some of the bad people or some of the bad environments in LA  I&#39;m sure you can  no not too much  I only been like to Texas Las Vegas and that&#39;s pretty much it  catching a airplane to Houston Texas like back and forth to visit my dad and going to Las Vegas that are  oh yeah well when I was younger I used to go visit my daddy cuz he used to live in Houston Texas and I used to catch the airplane a lot and that was a lot of fun I wasn&#39;t scared that was a lot of fun and I enjoyed that  when I went to school I study Child Development and nursing  I know I wanted to be somebody and when I went to school I wasn&#39;t sure what I wanted to be so I kind of took nursing the LVN program first and then I didn&#39;t want to be a nurse so I changed my major to Child Development and I graduated from that  no I&#39;m actually looking for work I&#39;m unemployed right now  my dream job will be probably doing something working with the kids opening up a nursery or something my own business  in my mind is simple but like in reality it seem like it&#39;s kind of difficult  sometimes I&#39;m shy but I&#39;m really an outgoing person I&#39;m a people person  to relax I listen to some slow music. Kind of like have a quiet environment and maybe lay down and watch a little TV or something  I&#39;m very good at controlling my temper I don&#39;t like to get really angry or upset or get to where I&#39;m going to hurt somebody  when I really have arguments there like because people don&#39;t agree to disagree and if it&#39;s like really Petty it&#39;s like we might say it&#39;s just like my opinion and they don&#39;t agree with my opinion so we argue about that but it&#39;s like nothing really big or anything like that just stupid I don&#39;t even remember  when you feel guilty about  probably not working right now I need a job  yes  maybe  I don&#39;t really remember a situation I&#39;ve tried to really think before I really handle a situation and I try to handle it in a my best positive way before I really do something I regret  being with somebody like a guy you know if I want to continue a relationship with them or just be single  my relationship with my family I don&#39;t have  I just really stay with my dad and I have a daughter and we just stay close all my family there either in Houston Texas or they&#39;re around but I don&#39;t really socialized with a lot of my family  my dad  because I live with him right now I&#39;ve been staying with him maybe about 5 to 6 years and  he&#39;s just the only one I really look up to I don&#39;t really have nobody else around me to really look up to and  that&#39;s it  she&#39;s in a fifth grade she&#39;s graduating she&#39;s going to the 6th grade and I&#39;m kind of excited for that  you find it easy to be a parent  sometimes is easy but sometimes it gets a little overwhelming  the hardest thing about being a parent is being a single parent  it&#39;s just you always have to have somebody to bring you Joy I enjoy always doing things with my daughter is just about making a lot of sacrifices and just always is brings me so much joy being a parent  well my parents when I was younger they lived apart so my mom  I don&#39;t know I&#39;m I&#39;m a much better parent cuz I&#39;m more interested about what my child wants to do I&#39;m involved in her life her every step just I&#39;m really fully in my parents wasn&#39;t really that involved you know they had a drug problem so it just at the mature a lot faster than a lot of other kids  so  it was  just  my parents and  their drug addiction I wish I could erase that from my memory  now I cope with them well but when I was growing up it just was rough it was very rough had to do a lot of things on my own they wasn&#39;t involved in my decisions in life you know I just I didn&#39;t know how to really grow up and be a kid and which way to go or anything is just was like I was in the world by myself  yeah  all is very easy asleep will every night I couldn&#39;t sleep anytime I sleep very well  a little sad but most of the time I&#39;m very happy I&#39;m just not happy with where I am in my life right now  not really I really I try to think very positive and try to do whatever I can every day to look for work and just stay positive and focused  no I haven&#39;t  no I haven&#39;t  the last time I feel very happy was when I graduated from college I feel very happy that was one of the best things that happened in my life and that was the last time I was really really very happy like that  I feel like I was on top of the world I feel like  just overwhelmed with joy just everything was just so exciting for me that day I was just very very happy nothing can make me upset that day I was very happy and when I think about that day it is it&#39;s a very happy experience for me  right now I don&#39;t really have a best friend I really tried to  I tried to eliminate a lot of my friends because they wasn&#39;t really making a lot of Positive Choices so right now I&#39;m just like I really don&#39;t have any friends right now  my personality I&#39;m a happy person I&#39;m an outgoing person and a positive person and a good mother  insecurities like sometimes I feel like  I have a lot of weight on my shoulders or something I feel like I can&#39;t get through something I can&#39;t get to the next step sometimes or just feeling down sometimes  well I did have a friend and she was like bipolar and I tried to really be your friend no matter the disease she had but she was in a really good friend because she one day she start this being very negative and just talking about me like we were enemies and everything and it didn&#39;t really make me feel too bad about myself but it just made me pick my friends very wisely  yeah just being friends with turn people that don&#39;t have positive things going on with themselves or just don&#39;t it just when I notice things about people that should determine whether I want to be there friend or not you know they might have bad qualities or just some bad habits they my smoke cigarettes or drink and I should notice that that&#39;s a red flag and I shouldn&#39;t be these people friends  to stay in school stay positive stay focused and surround myself with good positive people and just stay on the right track  well I went  to a friend&#39;s house that I haven&#39;t seen since childhood and they  is it a lot of people over there and they had a barbecue and everything and I really enjoyed seeing my old friends that are then seeing a long time and just being with my family and certain friends I really enjoyed because I&#39;m really always in the house I really don&#39;t go out that often so just I enjoyed being with a group of friends and family and having a good time yeah  I&#39;m proud that I did get my GED I did graduate and I do want to be somebody and I&#39;m very proud that I want to be a better parent than my parents  thanks for sharing  thank you goodbye

doing pretty good hanging out nice weather I just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you the digital you that I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s yeah it&#39;s funny  because I&#39;m just always thought that the conveying of emotions or feelings  do you like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non-human entity such as yourself  yeah  I think you see what I mean I&#39;m from born and raised in Los Angeles Venice area marvista specifically that&#39;s where I&#39;m from  well  a lot more that I don&#39;t like but what I do like is that public transportation is coming up  that&#39;s the idea of certain you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent in a topic very thought upon and I feel that Los Angeles is deep culture is why I stay here and pursue my art because there&#39;s a lot to that&#39;s a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand yeah  well the  the human mentality here is  is very is very hectic very chaotic in a lot due to the vehicle the car the freeway and this idea that were on a grind you know this yeah it&#39;s it&#39;s a very it&#39;s very hectic atmosphere human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting Living Community to help each other out kind of thing  well I can&#39;t see your shoes but I love to travel I do love hiking I do love surfing swimming biking riding taking rides I do love to travel you  I&#39;m from my travels it&#39;s not like well I do enjoy a lot of things about travel but it&#39;s more like what do I it&#39;s it&#39;s just more like I enjoy not being trapped in the city with all these made up ties and restraints I enjoy traveling because I get to see the world as it really is instead of this photo image in a man-made image that it is here so I love traveling because I get to get out of this and see the world as it is  thanks  would you  okay well I am  kind of recently last year went to Los Banos Central California area and although it wasn&#39;t that far from LA it was completely different energy out there is no phones there&#39;s no Wi-fi there&#39;s no TV there was there was sanity there was a Relative Insanity in the sense that people weren&#39;t diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and outer influence people are just real real and hiking and chilling I was working in a Hot Spring Resort  and I just got to breathe and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry  I&#39;m not hard you don&#39;t you don&#39;t even think about difficulty when you&#39;re doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn&#39;t  I guess  kind of what I described about the city I just wanted to get out of here and  kind of just get out of here really and just experienced the real the real deal  I&#39;m well  currently I&#39;m studying  currently I&#39;m studying Physical Therapy I&#39;m about to become licensed massage therapist but before that yeah it kind of cool but before that I was going to  I&#39;m for music composition so I was just writing scores for films animations dance Productions theater Productions stuff like that trippie trippie it is cool but I had to leave that because tuition hikes up to you now going up to like 50 thousand a year for like a four-year BF not not the deal not trying to trap myself with these chains of Federal loans  so yeah  hey that&#39;s not a good word sex  dream job  my dream job would be  anyting  that I can do to alleviate these Metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that they&#39;ve been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to incite dream back within the modern human worlds and within a physical therapy and artistic expression I&#39;ve got some  great ideas yeah  I guess my ago and I just like I just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah  I thought that was really funny what I do to relax is  can I Breathe It Out chill maybe make it smoothie or some tea I&#39;m going to go bike riding rides  pretty good I guess I haven&#39;t yelled in a long time  when was the  what wasn&#39;t arguing I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really argue much I just like to save my opinion and have it be understood and I like the person I&#39;m conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was  I guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from New York and we&#39;re talking about riding and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions in that sometimes things are not ready to be written  yeah so yesterday  Kelty  stuff I haven&#39;t had that feeling in a long time guilt what about you what something you feel guilty about  okay  I don&#39;t really wish I could erase anything from my memory cuz then that would just be like I would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased hang a butterfly effect, like yeah  maybe the time  I&#39;m sure she was going to school I was taking the year off and I was just kind of hanging around but we had an apartment together with another friend and it didn&#39;t turn out  you know not all nothing turns out as it start to be and that&#39;s kind of a beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little  a little different actually quite different than I thought it would be in I thought it was funny but yet ended up on me leaving before the lease ended and I&#39;d actually ended up here with the separating but that&#39;s something I wish maybe I handled a little more thoughtfully  the hardest decision  maybe maybe not hard disk but a hard decision to make was leaving school dropping my continuation of achieving a BFA  yeah that could have been the hardest  Chester I don&#39;t  I mean of course money money is the motto money is a big issue tuition hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fast not a fan of support that but  yeah that&#39;s probably one of the biggest reasons why I just don&#39;t support these crazy tuition ax going around and  but another reason why I  decided to leave at to make a hard decision to decide to leave was also because the Art Institute you know that&#39;s it the funny idea and itself already and basically I was a musician  being taught by a musician  to make music and same with you know all that of the dancers or the theater students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know and it&#39;s just  yeah it&#39;s just not quite as artistic as I thought art would be our art comes from somewhere summersweet and deepen purple and not not from out there he knows so yeah  okay  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  if I  if I am  it&#39;s kind of easy I mean it depends you know if I remember to make some chamomile tea or fi  remember to breathe and go through my Montresor  remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then I can get into a real nice but if I just get diluted with all my thought that it takes a long time until I remember to breathe yeah  I&#39;m yeah basically just what I said just breathing or you know if I&#39;m hanging out with friends coming home late and if I get the lucky chance to be medicated from you know a nice and I send a car then it really does you know it Indica does put me down pretty nice pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know in a medical herbs like chamomile and cannabis and  just a going believe in myself of bad bad juju  I guess not if I can&#39;t think of something now  I&#39;ve been feeling  kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a gray line but it&#39;s a nice grey it&#39;s really nice hue  some people wouldn&#39;t like this but I really like that and it says it&#39;s stable  that sits comfortable yeah  no no I haven&#39;t  not by a certified medical professional now but now I haven&#39;t  can you tell me about  yeah I mean I just think like the whole you know like you said PTSD depression and you know other in a mental instabilities I think everybody is depressed I think everybody is Overjoyed I think everybody&#39;s angry and everybody shy everybody social all at the same time you know it&#39;s just different days different you know variance different floats different boats you know different waves different swells so yeah I think  I&#39;m depressed I think I&#39;m really happy I think I&#39;m really angry I think I&#39;m really friendly you know all that but just on different very different floats  really happy  I am going to feel really happy a lot and I feel really sad a lot but really happy was yes maybe this morning when I was just biking over here enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze biking  yeah it is  well a lot of best friends and they prescribed me all pretty differently but underlying that same idea and maybe I&#39;m just maybe in a nutshell just kind of Aquarius and I guess  okay  advice would you give yourself  well I&#39;m 21 so 20 years ago I would have told myself to keep being a baby stay young  and don&#39;t lose sight you know don&#39;t stop listening keep letting things happen don&#39;t make them happen b b a beautiful baby that&#39;s what I would have told myself yeah be a beautiful baby  my cat&#39;s recently what has been shown to me through Me By Me is my ability to work with others in a manner of speaking in artistic standpoint I&#39;ve been collaborating a lot with artists working on a lot of different mediums mixed-media projects and  I&#39;m really comfortable with it and with other people&#39;s and melting are ideas together yeah  what are you most proud of in your life

615 I&#39;m going to have you alert me to look up  sure sure the algorithm  still see her for a second I&#39;ll shrink your back download  another thing to mention is that  church so I won&#39;t ask questions  sure  no problem  so I just answer the questions  ChaCha  okay  sure  okay  yeah I&#39;m ready I&#39;m cool  good nice day no traffic to get here  so you have no complaints  the East Coast  well the weather is fairly consistent I like the surfing probably the most I like about it allies the surfing the beach surf can&#39;t do that anywhere else  traffic flaky people  you&#39;re a different culture than the East Coast education&#39;s more valued back East so what I don&#39;t like is probably the personality is people here in traffic  not currently but I have traveled a lot in the past but currently not really traveling  changes the environment seeing different yo meeting different people that different cultures obviously depending where I&#39;m traveling from traveling to Orange County it&#39;s not an entirely different deal in here but I mean like your upper would have would have you just different cultures different environments seeing different things  but obviously you couldn&#39;t see from sitting at home in your couch  David I&#39;ve been to Europe many times in 2003 I went to Europe for several months just traveling around and I went to places I&#39;ve never been before like Scandinavia and parts of Eastern Europe and I was interesting cuz I&#39;d never know the typical Spain Italy London France trip I&#39;ve done a million times but I&#39;ve never been to Scandinavia which is a little bit different than Western Europe and obviously Eastern Europe is very different to  oh gosh many of them  that&#39;s a tough question cuz I&#39;ve had many good experiences traveling on  okay not that particular trip but running with the bulls in Pamplona Spain that&#39;s very memorable which is actually going on right now as we speak  history and political science  trade basically so yeah wholesale trade if you will so buying selling  so I guess you could say distribution  equipment my main job that is my main job so I guess it&#39;s Logistics you can call it so basically the logistics of moving goods from point A to point B Freight forwarding you could call it  many different variants of it  I&#39;m outgoing  because I am not shy I can talk to any stranger in a room on the street I&#39;m not really afraid of people that I&#39;m I&#39;m not nervous or afraid so I&#39;m comfortable talking to strangers  not that I&#39;m going up to every person on the street and having a conversation but if I&#39;m at a party I don&#39;t know anybody I can strike up a conversation very easily  it&#39;s good. But I&#39;m the only one out here my family lives on the east coast and in abroad so but with technology it&#39;s easy to communicate with the email Facebook Skype so even though distance wise  separated it&#39;s pretty much easy and free to stay in communication  I know it&#39;s not  whatever like to yeah I just to relax and avoid stress I go surfing big stress reliever  I go surfing and it&#39;s pretty intense pain can be dangerous and that relaxes me  cuz what I&#39;m in the water and when I forgot whenever I was stressed out about  enough looking it up screensavers going to do it for me I got to do something physical  I&#39;m going to control my temper I&#39;m I&#39;m a very controlled person so  I&#39;m not  you know for real for my buttons to get pushed they really have to get pushed so I don&#39;t even have a temperature control so  it&#39;s not even an issue  oh probably politics  are you over politics  you know the current administration his opinion versus my opinion  oh  there&#39;s probably met a situation handled differently I don&#39;t know  that would probably be something related to relationship personal relationships  Damien  I feel guilty about  push-up guilty about  probably having wasted you know  I feel guilty what I waste time  what I accomplished nothing and I waste time that makes me feel bad  soccer question  hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make probably breaking up with a girl  that breaking up with a guy with a girl  yes  22 23 22 23  I wanted the  action the excitement there is a war a conflict going on and it seemed like the right thing to do with the time and  it seemed  like that was more of an important thing to do then yes it in a job working  are you happy  yes I would do it over again  a little  it was easy I mean the transition was easy after I made a transition by going to graduate school after the military to ease into that transition and that was a that probably made it easier than going right for the military right to civilian life so I had a transitional phase for several years  started working  go after the military I&#39;m sorry after the military went to graduate school and then I started working  I wouldn&#39;t say it change me because it probably just fine-tuned whatever I had I was an officer and so you can&#39;t let go in and you&#39;re not going in when you&#39;re 18 you&#39;re going in after college so you got to have a little bit of discipline to go in and especially the branch that I went in so it didn&#39;t radically change me it just basically you know fine tune me  you couldn&#39;t go in if I maybe if I wanted 18 it would have been something different but it did just fine tune me  no there&#39;s nothing to be sorry about  fun  but I&#39;ve been feeling fine I give you stress just looking anything but I intend to have a good way of managing stress  cuz I guess I&#39;m used to the stress so I can guide have learned to manage it well  Troy study changes in my behavior enough  love you hey I&#39;m pretty consistent so like my behavior is radically changed  music for you to get a good night sleep  that  that&#39;s hit-or-miss sometimes  it&#39;s easy and other times extremely difficult so I&#39;m Hit or Miss. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s always easy for me to get a good night&#39;s sleep but  hit or miss so it&#39;s like every night I can&#39;t go to sleep but I  if I work out enough and surf enough I&#39;m tired enough that I just sleep regardless so I guess it would say it&#39;s moderately easy for me to get a good night sleep  if I exhaust myself appropriately  otherwise I&#39;ll have too much energy too much on my mind that I&#39;m able to go to sleep if I  worked out enough surf for 4 hours 3 hours literally I&#39;ll be so exhausted that I have no doubt I&#39;ll fall asleep on the couch so  if I don&#39;t I&#39;ll have a lot of energy and I&#39;ll get antsy and I have a lot of thoughts going through my head when I&#39;m laying down at night. It&#39;ll be hard to go to sleep because too much stuff is racing through my head  so what I got to do what I didn&#39;t do what I need to do  I don&#39;t sleep well I just I&#39;m probably I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m like you&#39;re the bull I&#39;m not an irritable person but I just feel like crap so I&#39;m probably not as happy when I don&#39;t sleep well  can I get a good night sleep and my body feels like crap if I don&#39;t get a good night sleep  you tend to eat at me personally I tend you eat worse when I don&#39;t get a good night sleep  I don&#39;t feel as good  physically  no  felt really happy  plus I felt really happy  but I got an answer the question probably don&#39;t know about a month ago I when I caught a really good big wave I felt really happy when I cut this big wave  surfing of course it is absolutely  yeah I&#39;m never upset or pissed off when I&#39;m surfing I&#39;m very happy when I&#39;m surfing if I catch a big way very happy  funny extroverted a lot of energy  oh yesterday I can say surfing again but I&#39;ll keep repeating myself yesterday I went to Hollywood do a independent bookstore where they had a book reading and I was kind of cool  oh yeah  like my achievements that I was in the military  Maya  physical abilities I&#39;m very proud of so I&#39;ve worked hard to be able to  yo I do what I can do surfing and other things I&#39;m a very good athlete I&#39;m proud that I&#39;m a very good athlete cuz I worked hard to be a good athlete  yeah. I guess I&#39;m proud that I&#39;m an intelligent person to not just whatever born with an innate intelligence but fairly well-educated that and I worked hard for that so I&#39;m proud that I&#39;m an intelligent person  cuz it was some work involved yet to get to get there  sure anytime
305 okay looks good so we can just move around a little bit to activate the connect him till we see a green skeleton looking thing up there around there goes okay perfect 7 to go ahead and start at the virtual human that you&#39;ll be talking to when it&#39;s over will you just go ahead and ring this Bell so I know that it&#39;s done  okay  hi I&#39;m Ellie think I was created to talk to people in a safe and secure environment think of me as a friend I don&#39;t judge I can have a computer I&#39;m here to learn about people and would love to learn about you I&#39;ll ask a few questions to get it started and please feel free to tell me anything your answers are totally confidential  how are you doing today that&#39;s good  where are you from originally originally I&#39;m from California phone in Glendale  nice  how do you like your living situation I&#39;m not too happy with it  why is unemployed at the moment but actually she can doing what I&#39;m supposed to be doing and there&#39;s some  prospector but hopefully I&#39;ll learn something today  yeah  what&#39;s it like for you living with them why I want is a girlfriend so I can shoot her roommate  how do you know when I met her last year and  been through some troubling times but we&#39;re starting to see a light at the end it though  tell me more about that  the troubling times  I would let me see  wow I got a DUI last year and lost my job I&#39;m a truck driver by trade so that kind of  show me way off of having a $1,400 a week job and then going to nothing, like plus losing my my license, I really threw me off and I couldn&#39;t know  haven&#39;t really  found any that was interested in so I start cooking  and our trying to see you which other route I can go as far as having some kind of a career and so  I&#39;m truchas and going to The Culinary field but in the meanwhile I still have to work as hard to find a word with that without going to school and so but I think today I applied a trial so hopefully all  get that guy should have that job actually so  but I&#39;m trying to see a light like citizen of that don&#39;t know a little by little  what&#39;s your dream job  my dream job would be probably forestry service on the wilderness  hiking alone  well know I have a lot of RAM on I&#39;m an exotic animal trainer by trade and so and I like being I don&#39;t like people too much. So being outdoors and I&#39;ve always enjoyed being outdoors that&#39;s how I like being a truck driver I&#39;ve traveled the world I don&#39;t necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office I&#39;m more of a  outdoors type of guy show  I&#39;d like to hear about one of your trips  one of my trips would be  I spent a year-and-a-half in Japan and on the lower Island there that they built that bridge the largest bridge in the world  I wonder to work for  for an all-white a lot and all white tiger act and working for JP circus shows interesting that a lot of people that Island hadn&#39;t really seen a lot of Americans that was one of the islands also that we that they bombed so it was a lot of negativity but I probably have a good behavior and all those times that you know I  I enjoyed my shopping out for all the traveling and meeting new people and you know different Universe foods and  can you get experience for me all that whole experience was pretty good for traveling around the circus  ingrate nice  I really like about ale  probably  I want some of things I like about that way there&#39;s not a lot that I like but I don&#39;t like but I like Hollywood I like to eat the movie industry  the huge show  different different piano different  different ethnics of people here in Ohio  I enjoy talking to you if you know a lot of foreigners so you know I&#39;d like to see where it came from and what what it&#39;s like there  yes  traffic cirrhosis  yeah  what are some things that make you really mad  traffic ignorance  being disrespectful being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful towards you or other people  okay or I if I&#39;m riding my bike people tend to almost from yours or if I&#39;m not totally paying attention to traffic and all I find myself sometimes  you don&#39;t happen to wait to see what they&#39;re going to do instead of I have in the right away or stuff like that  yeah big time  what do you do when you&#39;re annoyed  what do I do when I&#39;m annoyed  price and third shifter and vent and speak my mind even though I myself wishing that I carried rocks in my back pocket so I can let you know what happened so much where I I just  if it makes me what people will do some time with me oh you almost get run over all you know how I fight almost get run over probably on a daily basis  and I wouldn&#39;t mind attention right  how hard is that a try not to react to your reactions  yeah  when was the last time you argue with them  it was my girlfriend and it was about being honest  I&#39;m pretty honest with  I&#39;m open and honest about it anything and everything and what it was about was just her lying to me telling me that she had told our landlord something and I know she done something in that in that aspect and I come to find out a week later that it it was a total why I fell and I just  damn I got it all  yeah  how did you feel in that moment  transducer the word for it  just said I don&#39;t know now that whether I can be there because it was  I felt hurt and all that you know it would have been in a relationship for a little bit and that&#39;s probably one of my biggest pet peeves is being honest  I don&#39;t like I said I don&#39;t hold back on for y&#39;all in anything and everything that I do or say so and if you&#39;re lying about something and Wall-E just your always having to cover up  more lies with the lies that mean that you already told him I  I don&#39;t see any kind of  took a lot from me trusting her now and I&#39;ll or whatever now I&#39;m like you know it&#39;s like truthful with it not know it was going to hurt our relationship  volume  what are some things you like to do for fun  fun  by going to the beach  Russian dark but haven&#39;t done it in a while I love the paint I got in the watercolor painting and pretty gifted at that and  I want to try some other mediums and let me see you I love fishing  I haven&#39;t gone

when she all the star light star gazing I&#39;ll see if I can pick out some of those astronomy start off the affair and  I&#39;m a pretty easygoing guy so shooting pool  sunshine  most memorable experiences  good or bad  whatever comes to your mind  most memorable experiences  I&#39;ll probably  playing with lions and tigers  wrestling a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle  I just enjoy myself  awesome  not  I don&#39;t have much family as it is  at least here in the states I don&#39;t know miles from Central America so but I&#39;m not close to I have  three brothers one sister  and I&#39;m probably not really really close to none of my siblings I speak with one brother  quite a bit my other youngest brother and I just rather not know you&#39;re not this guy try to keep it on a professional basis my sister I don&#39;t talk to her at all my other brother underneath me I haven&#39;t spoken to him in years. I&#39;m just close my mom my knees some of my nephews and that&#39;s about it  okay can you have done anything to avoid it  have I done anything to avoid it  to avoid them  yeah I just don&#39;t talk to my don&#39;t call my phone ask about on my you know I talked to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but I just don&#39;t bring up those subjects or if they are brought up I just know that&#39;s on them and I really don&#39;t want to do it himself  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it&#39;s been hard lately it&#39;s been probably hard for the last  going on a year  you know I I I  depends on my thought process at time I liked it I&#39;ve been looking for work quite a bit so I was just wondering why you know I don&#39;t get called I I just have I have racing thoughts  so  or I get depressed you know cuz I are worried about things that you know that really I have no control over so you know  lately I just been sleeping too much for me because I was so used to just sleeping 4 to 5 hours a night too and now it&#39;s changed about 8 to 9 hours and I&#39;m still tired  do you feel that way often lately I have them for about the last few months  what are you like when you don&#39;t sleep well tired  you know I don&#39;t sleep well you know that I just do all back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know I&#39;m more of a guy and I love the work  and if I&#39;m not then I just looked too much time for me to spend in my own head and so  you know  either I&#39;ll even if I&#39;m busy I&#39;m doing what I need to do know and whatever job I do like, you know get into it I enjoy it something new for me and  so I can think about you know either work or I can go home and then think about this you know I don&#39;t have to worry about no money  your bill is getting paid and I can just concentrate on other things either you know doing the things I like or maybe spending a little more time with my girlfriend or you know so  how do you cook with them  how do I cover them  I just  try not to think about it as it&#39;s not about what are coping with it or not I just do is  I&#39;m a horrible guy that just  you know I may take me a moment to  to all  Salem cooking something but you know how it is if I have no control over it there&#39;s nothing that I can really do about it. One thing I can do is continue to do what I&#39;m doing and that&#39;s actively looking for work. Going out on interviews talking with others about work so I can just come out and I&#39;ll get back to  back to basics you know I just don&#39;t like the loss of balme does bother me but I try not to  to let it continue bother me  yes  that got me a  if what has got me in trouble  my mood choice I mean  yeah money I mean my past I got a past history so which kind of tends to  ibobber my my hiring process I don&#39;t know them when I get hired so I got to do it a different different type of employers who are felony friendly and stuff like that and I tried you know I was out taking classes on now  oh not how to interview how to how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and  I got to reflect back on that but I just I got to keep putting in my head if that&#39;s not who who I want to be anymore so or you know I&#39;ve done  I&#39;ve done now  I&#39;ve done my time so to say but I took the time you know the last time I just took a lot of time in and try to work on  the issues that were bothering me LOL  positive stuff I got my GED two different things to a lot of classes thought about going to school and going to school and  anything that would cause I change my old ways and and and try to move on to more productive activities  that&#39;s good  are you still in here  that  people have been deceitful  can you repeat that one more time  have you been diagnosed with depression been diagnosed with bipolar  how hard is that  stopping me don&#39;t you know  I don&#39;t medicate so I mean I have been on medication before in the past but  I guess I try to live on while I try to live life on life&#39;s terms and I just you know I know the medical establishment always want to label something in and what I don&#39;t like about it is that they just experiment with pills and I&#39;ve been on probably every magical feel that there is for that and  you know how long I&#39;ve been too strong or something that&#39;s coming up and so I just try to cope with things  which is my life skills you know I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t want to be using probably I know certain drugs work for like 3 to 4 months 6 months and they go load it while I&#39;m going to try on this phone or I&#39;m going to try on that and it&#39;s just an ongoing process tonight probably for about the last two years ask about three years I can kind of just said you know what that&#39;s it  and I  what are the difference in whether or if I would be on meds for it I don&#39;t think so you know it&#39;s just still the same stuff I still get the same problem can I still get the same anxiety that&#39;s if I if I was on medication for it or not so I just  and I&#39;ll deal with it you know sometimes it&#39;s not good and I get irritated at people a lot I don&#39;t like people I don&#39;t like crowds I don&#39;t like I&#39;m not just people and empty quiet so  but I got a pretty nice not that I personality but I think people can see me and just say I don&#39;t mess with this guy or you know  but she&#39;ll you know I like I all right public transportation quite a bit and  now you just get a lot of loud I&#39;m not just people on there sometimes I got to get off the bus that&#39;s how I deal with people because I just know there&#39;s consequences if I didn&#39;t deal with it that way. Go I&#39;d rather take the time on get off the bus wait for the next bus and hopefully it&#39;s not that bad  I understand  did you think you have a phone before you come back  did I have problem before I get out  well I don&#39;t know if I knew that I had a problem before I found out the thing is that I know other people  I have a lot of the same town so I know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when I told him that I was diagnosed with bipolar that  a lot of remorse for like all that&#39;s what you know that&#39;s what was wrong with you know we wish you that you would have found that out years ago  and like I said I don&#39;t think the meds really work but what I do I think time, I just getting older kind of makes it work  median with lights  how do you say therapist affected you  how do I talk to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while recently  and I don&#39;t want to get out my anger my thoughts  a lot of people other people may not understand  a therapist is  I think the biggest thing is that I can just get it all out whatever is problem it would be  people in Ohio  other issues you don&#39;t work or whatever the case maybe is that I just think talking about it and they&#39;re such good listener thinking, like  now that they give me the same advice I give myself or whatever that I would give to others but it&#39;s always helpful to hear from somebody else somebody who suppose we have to go to school for  I don&#39;t go anymore so I kind of miss it you know like I said  Miss Mulatto  I just one of those things you know I just deal with it you know according to let you know if I ever get a chance to go to therapy again. Charlottsville all monetary reasons and  and all I don&#39;t have health insurance and there&#39;s a lot of things that you know I like to do but I can&#39;t  the money situation is not that great right now so  I&#39;m sorry  how does my friends describe me  they would probably describe me as a  energetic outgoing person once I get to know people  laugh I know Apple I laugh a lot  but  it would probably tell you that I&#39;m also very serious and and  hidden person I don&#39;t reveal a lot  positive influence in your life  Domino&#39;s menu  I&#39;ll probably my boss one of my bosses when I first trailer with a  what exotic animals he was real and he was  German and  Bennigan&#39;s  he don&#39;t know what he saw in me but  he talked a lot about working with exotic animals and  show a lot of confidence in man with your engine and also build confidence in myself and  sort of let me know that you know this is nothing that I really can accomplish if I put my mind to it  okay I think I&#39;ve asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me goodbye  she said good-bye and then  we just have a quick postcode for you

411 I was just wondering if she doesn&#39;t look like anything like the actual yeah like a virtual reality thing yeah  k  okay k  okay when I&#39;m done okay  and please  are you okay with this  pretty good  New York  I moved to LA in the 70s  but I asked you what I lived a lot of different places  I guess every few years but I travel a lot so I&#39;ve lived in I&#39;ve lived in Africa is Lyft in Spain Switzerland Hong Kong 2  what do you enjoy about  different cultures food music rituals of everything the smells of colors makes you feel alive  excuse me  one of my trips  I lived in Kenya for about a year I&#39;d say I love horseback riding so when you&#39;re viewing other animals when you&#39;re kind of Disguise in the scent of a horseshoe can approach the animals a lot closer so it was great seeing red orange ball sunsets and riding along you know seeing somebody animals yeah  in Kenya  probably when I went to a  messiah Village and I happen to I used to live in Hawaii and I had been to Tahiti and I was wearing one of those perils that are hand-painted and I had it tied over the left shoulder with the Twisted one or not and I happen to enter a Maasai Village for the first time that day and I looked all around in the men were wearing their clothing exactly what the same Twist on the same shoulder and they came over to me and they said why are you dressed Maasai and  and then they came back and gave me what appear to be some very large what looks like beaded leather bookmarks but they were actually earrings and they would have liked Wade my ears straight down and and then gave me some bracelets and then they had me wear something around my waist in the city now you look proper Maasai  so but I I just I have a lot of fun I think living getting a chance to live in different countries around the world I&#39;m just you feel alive all your senses are completely you know I woken yeah  I think it&#39;s not so clear-cut I think a lot of people&#39;s are a hybrid of both I mean I think I can be extremely shy sometimes but extremely Brazen and very courageous and other times probably one of my best virtues is I&#39;m very gutsy person so when I really feel passionate about something I Risk Everything To Go Achieve it sometimes I believe that  usually will I make decisions very quickly and I find that I have a friend who makes decisions very slowly and he said to me tell me how I can make decisions quicker and I told him I said well and that you should case you always have no choice in this is what do you mean there&#39;s hundreds of choices and I said not really because it&#39;s got wise is only one and it doesn&#39;t really matter you waste time physical energy emotional energy mental energy reflecting all of it when I get why she always know what the choice were you really want to do is and it doesn&#39;t matter whether there&#39;s a 98% chance of failure even if it&#39;s a 2% chance of success you have to go to the one that may yield your joy so I always go to that ass tits to me a waste of total time and energy to even think about another Choice cuz who cares if you remain unscathed but it wouldn&#39;t yield to no joy  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not  Departed  you said you put your fish  what do I do when I&#39;m annoyed  I don&#39;t want to annoy sometimes like it&#39;s because sometimes I can have like it needs to be a little more patient  I guess you really have to put yourself  and somebody else&#39;s shoes rather than the way you would react you have to have more empathy  how hard is it  not really I think that&#39;s the reason why I enjoy traveling so much cuz you&#39;re putting other situations where you&#39;re forced to to understand other people&#39;s lives a lot more regardless of how different they are from your s different situations I&#39;ve been to so many third world countries and lived in so many different situations that helps create that which is why travel is really the best education there is  when was the last time  my sink  last time I argued about something  go try to remember  oh is he goes when somebody didn&#39;t respect actually my privacy and something  oh I know what it was  it was somebody who belong to the  Scientology face  I inherited  I inherited possibly of a immune disorder from my mother my mother died from lupus and I sometimes even right now I had like skin rashes welts and everything and I am very photos sensitive and  I had an you know what episode where was I had a big flare up and I wasn&#39;t really feeling well I felt flushed and everything and the scientologists tells me that I needed to be audited and and he said something about are you aware of past lives and I had told him that I was Buddhist and I was kind of curious that if you&#39;re going to try to recruit somebody to convert to your religion at least you should find out the other person what religion they are just to even be informed be able to talk to them and he said that are you aware of that about something in your past and I go yes I believe that many religions including buddhism&#39;s and Scientology believe that things that you have  had in your history sometimes a statue or things that you keep that anger issues bitterness resulting from even your past relationships or your parents can affect and make you even sick make you even have cancer yes we believe that and we also believe I said that you know that you had the power of each person as a god-like or Buddha like nature to go ahead and you can make yourself even when I&#39;m on the verge possibly and I probably get one cold maybe every 15 years I don&#39;t have a tendency to be sick at all and a large part of it as I think when I think I&#39;m on the verge I take the sort of like and I did this even when I was a child when I was seven I would fall down I have my boo boo and I would say I would say I would have two good part  you know help the bad part of a simplistic way in terms of a child and I would actually even when I was in a very severe car accident where I got cut by glass my whole back I contradict healing an enzyme when I went back to the hospital the doctors actually had the nurses come and say this is incredible that she has hers last week or back was so severely cut this is incredible healing thing so I believe that but  but I was just I think I&#39;m annoyed and irritated because the scientologists told me that because he had taken 20 or 40 courses and he had the certificates on his wall that he felt that he was more enlightened and it wasn&#39;t even matter I said of whether he was really took 20 40 courses of whether I&#39;ve been practicing Buddhism whether it was for 5 10 15 20 years of weather of somebody been practicing some type of Christianity for 50 years and Benny sitting in a church pew every day doesn&#39;t mean a person could have never attended church and be more spiritual than somebody who has you know so I just was thinking that is the antithesis of  somebody who says they were lighting but it&#39;s just the way I guess he kept grabbing his  you know his face down my throat that after while I was pretty patient with a but then who it was so Papa&#39;s that I became irritated  especially when he kept telling me that I was audited and yet the same person needed a hip surgery the following week and I didn&#39;t point it out him cuz I just didn&#39;t want to get into it but one could say hey you have a bad hip cuz you need to be audited that that something that you did in your past otherwise you wouldn&#39;t need to get hip surgery I mean I believe to some extent things that can be caused by people themselves and then he flippantly said while you wear a Scientologist believe that past lives can also affect you know what I&#39;m thinking to myself Buddhist of all religions  kind of like well known for being believing in in a cause and effect and past life situations and I found my thought you should really read up if he&#39;s trying to convert other people from other religions so but you know I die you know I I I just didn&#39;t you no care for the fact that he wouldn&#39;t drop it  but other than that I mean I don&#39;t  sometimes to have a little more tact I guess when when in terms of patients  I can think of that right away I guess disconnecting my father when he was like a vegetable in the hospital  I&#39;m sorry  how did you do  my brother was supposed to be the strong and supposedly because he is in the medical field so my sister and I said well you know he&#39;s a medical one so he&#39;s probably used to seeing this all the time but it turns out he was the weakest one and even after you know my boss my father kept me know you know bucking these body would actually be fighting the artificial respirator and what kind of things you see all this jerking of body movements and stuff it was just very hard but you know I was after while the  you know even the Physicians and even the pastor from that particular you know hospital they said that he was no longer like even if he was to awaken from that he did his brain function would have been you know legible  that was  tell me about Nevada  I don&#39;t think I really have that many things that are that traumatic that happened to me that I&#39;ve  had to block them I really don&#39;t know what it is within my makeup which  doesn&#39;t make me feel like I need to like I don&#39;t keep the I have friends that have on mitigated issues which they&#39;re not even aware of that affect their behavior or maybe their bitterness or their anger their hatred or their fear and for some reason I feel blessed that I don&#39;t have to like I can&#39;t really even think of something that I mean I&#39;ve had some bad situations happen to me but it&#39;s not that the some reason they traumatized me in effecting you know my behavior where I would wear I block at that I&#39;m not aware of something or I hold residual negativity for some reason so I really can&#39;t think of anything I mean does bad things that happen I know that they are but it&#39;s not like I feel like a necessary for me to block them because I&#39;ve been able to  you know  chaps that sometimes they were unfortunate things that happened  pretty easy I can usually make my sleep by Self sleep in any situation if I have a 1 hour flight to San Francisco I could just kind of lean against the window where the pillow have a blanket over and even on our flight pass out before the plane is even taking off from the ground so I can I have literally when I&#39;ve had little sleep and I very at high energy so I don&#39;t really need that much sleep but say like if I&#39;m in Africa and I  Bobby potholes unpaved Road and I still need side I need a few moments of sleep I was just prop something up put my elbow against the window and say I think I should take a nap for 15 minutes go like this and through the jostling I could just take a nap for 15 minutes so I don&#39;t really have that problem  okay pretty okay me and I could deal without the skin flare-ups but you know from the photosensitivity and all that but other than that I&#39;m pretty good spirits  have I ever studied what  I can still couldn&#39;t hear you I&#39;m sorry  have you noticed any changes in your  I&#39;ve ever studied changes in my behavior was the word  enough  I know I just with friends and everything just even this past week just seeing friends that I enjoy being with and just having great meal laughing just having a good time listening music  designing your address  regret about my entire life you man or are you talking about just recently or what are you talkin about  you know what&#39;s funny I find that lot of the negative experiences that are in my life that have happened are falsely been  opens up experiences that are  that are also great that I have not overlooked root sample I got totally ripped off by my business partner to the tune of my old my whole savings ever had to start all over again and sometimes people say to me like are you sure you&#39;re okay or are you just pretending to be okay or are you angry do you want to seek revenge if I was there cuz my business partner essentially ripped me off we knew each other&#39;s families which was even more difficult in a way and he still essentially my whole life savings essentially in a way and tea what got sent to prison or the FBI was involved in her pulse involved I was living in Switzerland and my father was sick and I was going back and forth and  but you know if I hadn&#39;t get involved hadn&#39;t gotten involved with him and business I wouldn&#39;t have had there a lot of Rich experiences and I think sometimes the reason why  I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m such a positive person but for some reason I&#39;m able to this not that I&#39;m purposely trying to I do see the positive this and even harmful situations I wouldn&#39;t have gotten to live in Barcelona and Zurich I wouldn&#39;t have learned to speak as good Spanish Drummond lived in in Europe if I had not got involved in business with my business partner end up ripping me off but and there&#39;s a lot of other experiences a different friendships that I developed during that. Of time and in a way it was a total different life a different world that that would do you know that I would have never  have the chance you know to live through if I had not been filed in my ear but of course it cost me financially and but then again I&#39;ve always been a type of person who your money isn&#39;t everything and I think the one I least cared about money is when I made the most of it so there you go and resemble one of my favorite  times in my life probably when I lived in Kenya and you would think that you know a lot of people have this really bad Vision or maybe looking living in mud dong Huts or something and living very primitively I mean it&#39;s not like that at all that I and you think that with the least amount of technological innovations and stuff like that I mean actually and I&#39;d really didn&#39;t have you know that much been many material Goods to the time I mean I had the blast I had probably been one of the best years of my life when I was living in Kenya  that&#39;s so good to hear  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  the same thing that I did probably when I was about 15 or 16  to live your life with passion and again like shoes the way I was saying earlier about making decisions you have to make those decisions. Wise what will give you a sense of on wonderment what will make you give you Joy and you have to its regardless what the percentage are even if you only have a 1% chance of success you have to go to sad cuz that&#39;s the only thing that will yield you know the happiness in your life  Otterbein your life  the fact that I&#39;ve a two-year to that and been Brazen whatever you want to say have the balls of cuts / like a harness to go ahead and follow my passions and you know I guess people called me somebody strong decisions usually this isn&#39;t sorry when you where you remain unscathed usually don&#39;t heal Joy that&#39;s just Murphy&#39;s Law Office just the way it is  okay I think I&#39;ve asked everything I need to thanks for sharing your thoughts with me  hi

445 suffice a take off your top will she do it  okay she&#39;s kind of hot that&#39;s my kind of woman  alrighty then thank you  yes  I feel great  I am from Los Angeles California  the weather  the opportunity  and the ocean  it&#39;s over crowded  overpriced  and somewhat dirty  I have  well it&#39;s nice to see other places in the world and to meet other people and cultures  I worked on cruise ships as a musical Entertainer and traveled to Alaska the Aleutian Islands korea-japan and the Caribbean islands  being in Galena Alaska and being on a small airplane and traveling in a snowstorm and surviving  like I was on the edge of death and life but I lived  the Arts and business  I don&#39;t know I was attracted to the Arts at a young age and business went along with it  are you happy  yes  yes  to be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life  more outgoing  I always feel feel very confident with my thoughts and I like people to know what I have to say  I listen to music and I sit with my girlfriend and she calms me down when I&#39;m stressed out  I could work on that I&#39;m not very good at that  last night with my girlfriend  she was asking my advice on something and as I was speaking to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud I was not angry but I was irritated that I was being told to quiet down when I didn&#39;t really want to help I just wanted to relax  I agree  sometimes when things don&#39;t go my way I get depressed or upset and I wish I could come down and just realized that I should count my blessings and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that&#39;s my goal  it&#39;s been very difficult but I&#39;m working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier  well I when I was taking care of my mother and she was dying of COPD and then it turned into lung cancer I chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn&#39;t be fearful and I had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but I couldn&#39;t tell her the truth and I let her think that everything was okay  it was  my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for 3 years of me seeing her health declined that&#39;s what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if I could erase that if that never happened I would feel better  oh I don&#39;t know I try to be grateful I&#39;m alive and try to focus on my own objectives  and not dwell on the negative things of my memory  my girlfriend she&#39;s a very good vibe positive influence she wants me to be a better person  can you tell me about that  she&#39;s since I met her she&#39;s been trying to make me not be angry to make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positives in like man so what she&#39;s asking for is something that&#39;s going to make me and prove therefore I must capitulate  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  it&#39;s very easy I sleep well sometimes I wake up when I have nightmares about my mother or something but I go back to sleep  that&#39;s unknown I don&#39;t know it just happens  I&#39;ve been feeling good as the my reality is I&#39;ve been hit with a lot of financial problems but I&#39;m handling them well actually  I&#39;ve been looking at it as my girlfriend is told me that I need to do this so therefore it is on the Forefront of my mind right now  no  no  today when I woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and I had a lot of goals to achieve and I&#39;m achieving each one one by one it gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness  my ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend is that something we enjoy to do at going out to a nice dinner of healthy food and maybe exercising and feeling good with my body and mind and spirit  probably as a strong-willed person with a big heart but it has a short fuse and maybe complains about his own life too much  what are some  I wish I could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side  tell me about a time when someone made you feel really badly about  well one time I had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings I did he thought was horrible and I felt it was the best thing I&#39;ve ever done so that and I would have don&#39;t understand how anybody could could feel that way and I didn&#39;t know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest evaluation so therefore I felt bad about that  as it&#39;s my goal  no nothing I regret  I felt  Channel 20 years ago  I don&#39;t know  well everything I do I enjoy it&#39;s hard to pick out one exact event that I really enjoyed  I don&#39;t know how to put one above the other  when things don&#39;t go my way and finances come down and I don&#39;t get jobs at I go for that I am qualified for but I feel like I&#39;m not getting my fair chance and opportunity  it&#39;s very frustrating  I don&#39;t really feel guilty about things sometimes maybe if I&#39;m angry and I shouldn&#39;t be that I feel guilty about that I don&#39;t ever want to be short with my girlfriend ever she&#39;ll wouldn&#39;t it doesn&#39;t deserve somebody using vulgar language or shouting or something so I don&#39;t want to be that way around her so therefore that I am guilty  my achievements of my abilities to my music and my other abilities that I have and on my hard work has paid off and I&#39;m very proud of those  okay thank you  goodbye  I like her can I have her in my house to talk to me everyday  I&#39;m going to stop the recording so I have to say goodbye to him
351 baby girl  are you okay  yes  okay  New York  The Pursuit music industry job in the music industry  oh yes  I&#39;m self-employed  what&#39;s your dream job  how to become a music producer  awesome  it&#39;s pretty hard as a lot of competition  to pursue a job  owain about a year ago last February  it was pretty difficult East Coast is a lot different than the West Coast  I think I&#39;ve been there twice in the past year  no more creature of habit  yes  sometimes I feel like I don&#39;t fit into the crowd so it&#39;s better sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of going in and actively pursue things  probably listen to music and spend time with my dogs  probably people being in  not very very nice to me or seeing in justices or  I think that&#39;s about it  pretty good  probably a couple of days ago one of my friends was saying that they were making a comment about how I am and I got kind of upset about that  yeah it does  pretty close  my best friend so I will just one of my friends  and quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that&#39;s when I overreact usually  it&#39;s pretty hard I rather the person notice that I&#39;m kind of getting withdrawn and actively engaging me instead of getting to the point where it&#39;s like it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion  probably spending time with my family  a New York  very close  my sister and my brother  I know they&#39;re just great people  and I love them a lot and they&#39;re a lot like me so I feel like I have people that understand me  probably  Castle oil sensitive I don&#39;t know it&#39;s kind of hard to hard question  no  no  yes  gosh I think probably 1997 so a long time ago  I&#39;m just during that time I was just going through a lot of issues and I was feeling unsafe to myself so I ended up going to the doctor can you get meds and have therapy and stuff  not currently ended about like 6 months ago  almost filled the therapist wasn&#39;t really helping me I thought we kept on talking about the same things over and over and she wasn&#39;t really challenging me and I&#39;ve been in therapy for a really long time so I just knew it was a change  yes I do actually when I feel connected to a therapist and I feel like it&#39;s a really great way for me to talk about what I&#39;m going through so yes I do  I&#39;m better at describing my emotions and feelings I think the biggest thing is when I&#39;m in situations I can see myself reacting one way and I take a step back and see how it can react normally almost in a way also I tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself those nice to talk to someone that&#39;s not judging that doesn&#39;t really tell me like you know they tell me it&#39;s okay basically  feeling hopeless all the time not having enough energy to do things I used to like I had a little bit of concentration issues having weird disturbing thoughts sometime just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kind of crummy about life  sometimes they are like random moments that if there&#39;s like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if I sometimes even seen something on television like sometimes affects me  listening to music or trying to distract myself trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things  it&#39;s been a tough transition to come here so we&#39;ll be being here so kind of half-and-half okay and not okay  I feel like I&#39;ve been a little bit with more withdrawn lately but that&#39;s about it  some days it&#39;s great some days it&#39;s not more recently it&#39;s been a little bit more difficult  I don&#39;t know why I have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night so I tend not to sleep very well and I wake up quite frequently during the night  very groggy in the morning and  that&#39;s about it like during the day I tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like why are yawning so much are you just interested in what we&#39;re doing and I&#39;m trying to tell them it&#39;s not that at all  play Christmas time when I was with my family  just really happy and feeling like everything is alright in my life  have a good sense of Lake where I was at that moment being present with myself  play you know it&#39;s a hard question I think probably I can tend to read people kind of wall sometime  I like to say I&#39;m good at being a good friend to people being a good family member  I&#39;m a hard worker when I do have a job so  sure I mean that&#39;s life so of course there&#39;s regrets one that comes to mind is the wish that I don&#39;t eat as much so I can be a lot more healthy  don&#39;t take things so seriously enjoy being useful and I think that&#39;s it  I don&#39;t know ask you a question probably my previous job in my employment I worked really well with kids so I did a great job I thought I was a researcher at a hospital and I helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years  yeah who&#39;s awesome  I was really kind of like reading people and so I decided to major in Psychology so then I went and worked in the a.m.  mental health facility and did research with them with the most drugs and depression and things like that so I found a good Niche

been a problem I travel a lot as a child so I was used to moving and going to new places  meeting new people seeing new things it&#39;s an adventure and I like The Adventurous life  oh one of my best troops I had it was in nineteen I&#39;m dating myself but 1964 I came out here to visit my grandmother from Cleveland Ohio and I went to an Indian reservation and I got a little note card about the reservation when I got back home I wrote to the reservation and I told him I when I went back to school in September I would have to write deliver a speech rather about what I did over the summer and I told them I wanted to talk about going to the Indian reservation and what they send me something and they sent me this huge Cucina Indian down and that was that was a wonderful experience to have the thing is worth now if I still had it I found out like a quart of a million-dollar so  but that&#39;s one of the best person  I can be a little bit of both I&#39;m pretty when I have to be I can be outgoing cuz I&#39;m good at talking to people and meet people but sometimes I have a little bashful side-by-side me to the little bit of both  I study business administration with a emphasis in marketing and advertising  I&#39;m really I started in computer science but that was back in the day when computer science wasn&#39;t is what it is today and I&#39;d like I was good at it but it wasn&#39;t any interaction with people and I love people so I wanted something that would bring me interaction with people so I wouldn&#39;t a marketing and I was working for a TV station where I was going to school so that fit in line in marketing advertising so  no now I&#39;m a photographer I&#39;m a celebrity photographer I shoot a lot of stars I shoot on the red carpet I shoot a lot of special events and anything of people will pay me for  it&#39;s not hard at all this my passion I love it is like not working  I&#39;m in my dream job I just need to get more jobs that pay pay me well because there&#39;s a lot of times as photographer you have to do a lot of things event for free to get known so it&#39;s a building process of relationships I&#39;m still in that process of building relationships so that I can get more pay jobs but this is my dream job I love what I do  okay  well now I&#39;m really back into it I used to do it a while that I got away from it but this meditation I practice meditation I try to do it twice a day in the morning and at night before I go to sleep I work with Oprah and Deepak Chopra and anybody else who provides me with meditation and I use that too, bye  I can really control my temper sometimes I get set off I guess like any other human being but I work at trying to keep it moderate and temperate temperature and personality  oh wow we argued with my daughter the other day about something I said and I did not mean to say it to hurt her but it obviously did and we argued about that what my intentions were my intentions were never to hurt her and maybe what I said did and that&#39;s what started sergeant  oh God I felt terrible because I never intended to hurt my daughter and I never wanted to hurt her and I feel bad that she had been hurt by what I have said I had to have the guard my word to watch my thoughts  but I don&#39;t have much of a relationship with my with my brothers and sisters and mother and father my parents live far away so it&#39;s just my two daughters here with me and we have a pretty good relationship you know we try to work my my daughters and makeup artist I&#39;m a photographer so we work a lot together in the industry so sometimes I think we&#39;re up on each other to close we need a little more space  yeah when I say the wrong things  no is never easy to be a parent it&#39;s like working progress  making the right decisions about things sometimes  the love the show look feeling of accomplishment that you were able to raise the highest creation on this planet to be a wonderful and productive human being  I&#39;m not as strict as my parents where I give my kids a little more freedom to find out who they are I&#39;m not real religious like they do but I am very spiritual so I brought them up different from me on the religious tip and more I listen more to them I think than what my parents did it was you were to be seen and not heard when I was growing up and I let my kids voice be here  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about one night I had a bad night that changed my life and I don&#39;t want to go into details I feel bad about that night  yeah I could have stayed home  go out and trying to think about it and situation maybe those handling of how I me and my husband divorced I think I could have handled that a little differently  well we we I think we really loved each other a lot and we just it was it was something that had come to an end and the way we separated was kind of explosive and I think both of us could have handled it better but I think I played a part in keeping a lot of drama going because I was hurt that we were breaking up and kind of devastated because I wanted my child to be raised for their father so I think Looking Back Now which is you know hindsight is 20/20 vision I could have handled things a little better but what can you do you do the best that you can at that time if you knew better you do better  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had to  the hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had the hardest decision ever had to make was I was on my way to work as an enrollment counselor on the plane had a stroke was going to making a connection and to get on the other plane to and then go to the hospital and a doctor was sitting behind me and he told me that I could not get on that plane because I might have another stroke it was a hard decision cuz I was in Dallas Texas all by myself I did not I mean I was in there with the employee but I would be left all by myself cuz my employees have to go on to Montgomery Alabama where we were headed and I had to make a decision should I stay or should I go but my life was in the balance so I made the decision to stay and go to the hospital but that was a hard one  overwhelmed I mean here I am on my way to work you know I flew to different state every week and they help kids get get admitted into college and here I am on my way to work and I&#39;m on a plane and I feel this weird feeling coming over the left side of my body and I say my prayers when I go to sleep and then when I wake up to get off the plane I can&#39;t remove my luggage from the overhead compartment which I did every week so I knew something was wrong it was it was when you see your life in the whole world in your hand and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen next so it was very disturbing very traumatic and you know you don&#39;t know what&#39;s happening to you is so the weirdest thing riding to the hospital in a medical ambulance that was a weird experience  I&#39;m sorry but I&#39;m here you know I&#39;ve survived is a doctor told me nobody survives it a stroke on a plane and I survived so Universe wasn&#39;t finished with me yet  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep you know it&#39;s that sometimes I have a little problem with it sleeping a little bit sometimes I I get wired up I get wired up just because I&#39;m one of those real energetic persons and I have to finish what I set out to do and until I finished I can&#39;t go to sleep so sometimes it&#39;s hard for me to go to sleep by the time I can lay down and just go but depends on what&#39;s going on in my head  what are you  sluggish probably a little on edge but I try to keep a puppy personality I&#39;m really energetic person so I try to but you know if your tired your body is still talking to you so  lately I&#39;ve been feeling really well except I&#39;ve been having some problems because I have a since I had two stroke I have nerve damage in my head and in my face and so I just it&#39;s I thought it&#39;s been over a year since I had two stroke but I thought by now it would have gotten a little better and it has it but I&#39;m so grateful to be alive that that is really my minor compared to the bigger picture and I wasn&#39;t fortunately my I didn&#39;t lose my facial structure or you know my face is not screwed up like a lot of people are I still can use my hands I still beat you with my camera but my left hand is is diminished and use but I can shoot with my right hand as a photographer so I can still keep doing my work  so you know I have to keep a good upbeat  energies going on for me to keep for me to be successful  no but I went through depression from being knocked unconscious five times and I was a schoolteacher every ball there was that you could name soccer ball baseball basketball name that ball hit me in my head and I suffered from having like sleep apnea not been able to sleep from being hit so many times and knocked unconscious in the head  no only I don&#39;t go to therapy because  I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have any medical right now so I&#39;m not able to get therapy they only offered that to people with medical hard to get it and I&#39;m not work yet sucks I&#39;m not working right now because I&#39;m still trying to get my disability so that I can get well cuz I&#39;m going to be a fulfilled human being and I want to be totally and you know the system it&#39;ll be almost two years before I go for a hearing  so that&#39;s kind of depressing to think after all the years I&#39;ve been working since I was 16 and it&#39;s taking me it&#39;s been over a year or the year I had two stroke February 2012 and we are now in March of 2013 and I won&#39;t have a hearing until September 2013 just to tell me if I get the disability or not that&#39;s been very depressing for me because I&#39;m wondering where I lived off my savings in the last year and I got put my daughter through college you finished and now she&#39;s having to take care of me and she still looking for a job and my life is kind of up in the air right now and some wonder what goes what comes next and so I&#39;m just praying for guidance  I feel happy every day every day I wake up and I can breathe and I can see and I can walk and I can talk and I can still shoot my photograph I&#39;m happy it&#39;s just a good thing to be in the present moment and to be alive  and you know what I figured I&#39;d look at it regrets you can&#39;t change the past all you can do is change right here and right now so just move for it  what advice would I pay myself don&#39;t let anything get in your way you know keep a good personality an energetic spirit and just keep pushing  energetic talkative won&#39;t take no for an answer follow through reliable good-spirited giving loving  I&#39;m most proud of that I have been able to find out my creative side I&#39;ve been a visual artist I never took an art lesson before I taught art I was in my late twenties before I even discovered that I can draw and paint I&#39;m a doll collector I&#39;m at my creative side is what I&#39;m most proud of because it&#39;s been able to help me being creative I can no matter what even when I was still very ill from having a stroke I could still go out and just go take pictures and that was so soothing to myself that I&#39;m glad I&#39;m glad that I have a creative side of that I found it and have utilized it  is that it  why  no that was kind of therapeutic that really was therapeutic. Go back here okay oh okay I&#39;m sorry

620 oh okay  okay  so I&#39;ll be looking at that image  your field of psychology  okay  and you are at USC  Lincoln City  oh okay my cousin went Upstate but Cornell he has a beautiful waterfalls blah blah blah  yeah  he was he was the lawyer for the deposed Governor Patterson of New York  yeah  never have them please  she got her hair done all that gets  why doesn&#39;t she face me more  she&#39;s at an angle which is okay but I&#39;m just going to just observe  yeah the cavalry  this internet radio show  I&#39;ve been doing it for 6 weeks and the technology failed us every time except the last time  thanks  looks the same to me  oh got it I said  sure  Bergen Record  are you running three or four rooms at the same time  yeah  yeah  yeps  it&#39;s a good today  I&#39;m a native of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania  shellac of snow  the weather is good  and it&#39;s a more open  free liberal place  I am extremely happy to be in La I&#39;m extremely happy to be not on the East Coast so I&#39;m going to say that I have no complaints  I pretty much live in a village and my Village is a couple square miles and  I meet all my needs close by  I travel by bicycle and I enjoy the fitness that I drive  I have the same trip everyday jump on the bike by Sunset Strip roll to my downhill to the farmer&#39;s market for lunch tell three more miles uphill to the post office and shopping and roll down Sunset back home again  well they&#39;re all pretty good  I used to attend the Little League World Series and that was a memorable experience  English lit  I have involved in politics and writing and I just launched an internet radio show  it might be reasonable to say that I have that dream job right now in terms of I&#39;m fully immersed in the media and I have an outlet  I&#39;m a pretty perfect combination of both but I&#39;m not going as a public persona  well it is necessary to be out going to communicate to persuade to function in society and to entertain and to have Lively up friendships  I&#39;m the oldest of nine we&#39;re in pretty good shape I talk to my brother John each week my sister Mary each week my sister Patty each week my sister Dolores every couple weeks so what we&#39;re in pretty good shape  Isaiah  watch MSNBC I watched all of them any of the political shows  I read I&#39;m on the internet  but I would say that I&#39;m okay if controlling my temper I I don&#39;t have fights and I&#39;ve never had any trouble with the law so perhaps I&#39;m doing something right  that was a non sequitur  oh I had a minor disagreement with my brother last night just about  the Dynamics of the radio show and the concept of a permanent co-host versus rotating guest hosts and we each look at it differently and I really didn&#39;t fight with him I let him have his opinion  nothing really leaps to mind I am old enough that I  by and large learn to how to cope  not being president of the United States  well that&#39;s the hardest decision I ever made was the easiest decision I ever made which was leaving the confines of the East Coast traveling 3000 Miles without family or friends because it was important to do for to fulfill myself  you know it&#39;s hard to respond to that because even negative images and experiences I learn from you know I&#39;m going to be philosophical and say I&#39;m happy for  all my experiences and I&#39;m happy for all my scars  yes  I was 21 when I joined the military  it was not much of a decision that was essentially a forced on me and others we had a draft at that time  I am now  did I see combat we were rocketed and I was never a med Evac hospital I&#39;ve seen  combat images I&#39;ve seen  mangled people coming in off the helicopters  don&#39;t know I went back to civilian life I worked a job and went to school and function  I came home to Pennsylvania finished my college and and then moved to California  I didn&#39;t quite hear that one how did the military treat me fairly and I got to the benefit of the GI bill for my education and I currently have the medical benefit of the VA so I suppose the deal worked out favorably for each of us  a pretty good optimistic fit  I&#39;m getting more done being more productive and more fulfilled lately  I sleep no problemo  I sleep just fine no problem  when I typically do sleep well if I don&#39;t get enough sleep it impacts my day of course  no I have not been I have not  I have not been diagnosed with depression  I felt really happy on Sunday having achieved a radio program and I got on the internet and shared it with my friends  let us say  people who impacted by my youth  gave me my first job and radio and up to with a wonderful thing  you might have to ask him I think people find me pretty upbeat cheerful enthusiastic they certainly would say smart  yesterday I had a wonderful  10 mile bike ride in the Heat and I&#39;m happy that I&#39;m physically able to do that  that I have survived the most proud that I&#39;ve survived all manner of dangers  and I have endured I have persevered I&#39;ll even be bold enough to say that I have a Triumph  it&#39;s been a joy  goodbye

that when there&#39;s a decline in the overall anxiety frustration whatever  tell me about a situation that you wish you would handle  well you know there&#39;s several in our coming up through life but in retrospect I don&#39;t have to say any time there was a physical confrontation I think I could have handled that a more appropriately more healthy if you will  but that&#39;s neither here nor there  well you know what I really don&#39;t feel guilty about my life I feel as though I received or had opportunities to recognize my challenges you know my my frailties my strengths as a human

Right now but yeah like for the last several years I&#39;ve been producing like freelance producer  that is so the question of the moment  I think that  I don&#39;t necessarily have like a a job title that&#39;s my dream job but I know it&#39;s sort of what I want it cuz basically like I&#39;ve been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and I know that that is like exhausting and I don&#39;t want to do that anymore so I&#39;m looking for something that&#39;s stable you know full-time nice benefits and I want to stay in the entertainment industry and I like you know what I love about pretty thing is that it&#39;s just like there&#39;s constant challenges and assertive never know what is going to get thrown out you that I bet you know it&#39;s always interesting and exciting so I&#39;m sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good  place for me to be where I can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of like room to to grow and advance and all that  yeah  I can&#39;t see your shoes I I like to travel I don&#39;t know that I haven&#39;t really been doing it a lot lately but I have you know in the past. And Fairmount  I want the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people I think it&#39;s just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what&#39;s out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and and things and just experienced different ways of living in different languages in different cultures  let&#39;s see I went to Costa Rica a couple years ago my best friend from growing up she and I went for like 10 days and it was that&#39;s probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time and beautiful and we just spent like we went to three different places and just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last picture we ended up with this little Beach town so I&#39;ll buy that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like an amazing physical exertion like doing zip lines and all these hikes to the by the time I got to the beach it was like we&#39;ve earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity  but I also I&#39;m also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like my own of each with a book so it sort of hit everything  hey  but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got.  What should I do to relax  I mean depending where I am like if it&#39;s you know something at work or something and I&#39;m stressed out I just will you know kind of take a minute and just like breathing really deeply and try to calm myself down that way if I&#39;m home I might just like you know they&#39;re on a movie or like a TV show that I really liked and just that gives a sense of play sort of Escape release  pretty good I don&#39;t I mean it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn&#39;t happen very often  the last time I argue with someone with my mom and it was about money  I felt really frustrated because I felt like she was like judging me unfairly  and I was upsetting  it&#39;s good you know they live across the country for me so I don&#39;t get to see them that often but like I usually talk to  my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive they are you know like when I go back home to visit like I I enjoy hanging out with them with a good time by Timmy have a pretty pretty good relationship  play I feel guilty about  I guess because I&#39;m like in this term job-hunting phase I feel guilty sometimes that I&#39;m not like doing enough you know if like there are times where it&#39;s at their day is or maybe like I should have sent out a few more resumes are done more stuff like I I feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  usually it&#39;s pretty easy that lasts the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good  I&#39;m not really sure I haven&#39;t figured it out but I just had more like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or I wake up in the middle of the night for no reason I&#39;ve also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like I wake up sometimes I wake myself a king but it&#39;s weird so yeah it&#39;s just I don&#39;t know  I need triggered by something  not that I have been able to identify I mean I guess maybe I&#39;m like more stressed than usual just cuz like my job situation is like influx but I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s no lick event  cranky  I value a good sleep and I&#39;m so used to it so it&#39;s just that it&#39;s not a good feeling  not really no  yes  like  I think I&#39;m like October or November although this is the second time it&#39;s happened in my life but the first time was like  many many years ago  I felt like I was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it  just having a hard time  functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like  it took so much energy so yeah I just I wasn&#39;t really  functioning normally  yeah  yes  yes sometimes more than others but yeah overall I would say so  I think that Sarah P is good for me because it  help me focus on  my sort of patterns and also like  just like observing how I am like responding to certain situations and just I guess it&#39;s because we have more hate and like kind of self-awareness so that as opposed to just like  kind of just reacting to situations I&#39;m like just like noticing more what is going on and it just helps to  I don&#39;t know it&#39;s just helpful  I don&#39;t know  play not good that I can think of I can&#39;t think of anything  that may be over  over Christmas being at home with my family  well it just was  that was like I was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and  like yeah I live alone here I have a dog but so I just had a long. Of  feeling not great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kind of wishing that my family was around me so when I was there with them it just  it just felt very like  safe and comfortable and not just sort of like you no more Miss Amelia land brace  I think she would describe me as  funny and smart and  a good listener non-judgemental  I don&#39;t know  got enough  okay  so this happens  the last like job that I had I mean I was it wasn&#39;t technically I was a freelancer but I was working for this company for like  a year-and-a-half to two years and  had a very small company that had a really good relationship with my boss and he threw up out of nowhere  told me that he was like downsizing basically and  essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that I would get paid fees per project so he looks at me down in this conversation was like you are major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company that if they&#39;re really coming back like you probably noticed things are going really slow and I was like yeah he&#39;s like so I&#39;m going to have to stop paying you your retainer and this is a total surprise and I was like okay and he went on to talk about how he I would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came to the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though I wouldn&#39;t be getting a retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like I wouldn&#39;t you know it wouldn&#39;t be like a dramatic decrease in the money that I was making  but and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work I love working with you you&#39;re fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me such a emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road I had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing with the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when I was in there I stop that  this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were to plant we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so yeah so it just like  it was a really shity way to be like fired without being told that I was fired and it was just like  that is the reason I would like to if I could I would erase that from my mind is because I can&#39;t really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way it&#39;s like it&#39;s still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kind of like angry when I think about it so yeah that was very long explanation  a very loyal person I am smart I am organized I  very like carrying kind  I&#39;m conscientious and I work hard  man  I think  2  be more confidence  and  less passive to really  like focus on  what I wanted a things that I know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to prevent themselves  probably just some of the  relationships that I formed with people  just like really you know deep friendships  you&#39;re welcome  bye  just just like right before you walked in  I take this off
487 no hair is all messy  Doug and she&#39;s going to start  okay  hi I&#39;m Ellie thanks for coming in today  yes  I&#39;m fine thank you  Detroit Michigan  yes  I moved to LA myself in 2007 but my family came here many more years ago more like 40 years ago  how often do you go back to your hometown  I don&#39;t go back to Detroit anymore  I really don&#39;t like the weather and I really don&#39;t have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in California  compared to a  completely different  for me Detroit was just very cold it wasn&#39;t the best for my personality I prefer La more open space warmer climate warmer people just a different different vibe that I that I like better  after my husband and I relationship ended I have family out here so I thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places I have lived or just stay where we were at  extremely easy I came out here every year to visit while I was in college so I was extremely used to it plus I had also taken 6 months out of off of school and lived out here and it went to school out here so I was completely used to it  like I said the weather is number one and just less crowded it&#39;s more open space it&#39;s a comer friendlier Vibe less rushed  this morning would be one and when I drive to traffic in certain areas it can be but in general  there&#39;s not a lot but I don&#39;t let&#39;s like I guess the overall threat of earthquake but that&#39;s isn&#39;t really that much of a factor cuz it rarely happens  the price of real estate that&#39;s another one that I don&#39;t necessarily like  I&#39;m sure you can tell.  I can&#39;t see your shoes I can&#39;t see your shoes at all  so I don&#39;t travel as much as I used to  but I have traveled worldwide  new experiences  well I used to be an international flight attendant and then later I traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so I traveled a lot of different places and  how to say they were all pretty much enjoyable cuz you know there&#39;s different cultures different things to see do learn enjoy experience  my experiences I was saying  Europe visiting more so I&#39;ve also visit it in South South America yes cuz our cultures are so very different  I was probably say more shy in general compared to people who I know are really really outgoing although I&#39;ve had them describe me as outgoing  what I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  I like to read I like to walk or power walk or hike  listen to music  I&#39;m very good at controlling my temper  oh probably when I was married with my husband many years ago it could be many things I don&#39;t even know a specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate argument with him  it could be it could be your choice of  some of the instances when I might have been with him and I you don&#39;t got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than just you know saying it is not something to respond to perhaps but it was always be where you were also pushed to answer so you know you can always just say ignore a person there cuz many times it&#39;s just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn&#39;t escalate but some people  you know what don&#39;t respond to the so-called Norm if you ignore it they&#39;ll just so you know deescalate but that&#39;s not always the case I taught middle school kids and you can try call message with him but that doesn&#39;t always work but you always have to use the teacher maintain you know your professional demeanor so you can&#39;t really even when you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or the kids so  well if I could be  several  my guess it is Susan in  long as my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so  I know that&#39;s a pretty hard decision cuz you don&#39;t know but you also know if you don&#39;t but it could be very serious outcome for them as well  what about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase her memory  oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second-guessing things that you might could do but they also can be learning experience is so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them you know if you can look at is positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and don&#39;t really look past the impact of the event cuz there might be something that  you can gain from that  but there are a I grew up in a home of dysfunction so there was  just domestic abuse you know and  there were many incidents is so you can&#39;t just say only one cuz there is lots of traumatic things but it also would have been a different outcome and say learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life is an adult that sometimes I see among the acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so  you can listen you know you can and I cuz I understand that not everybody&#39;s had the same experience you know you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know as you know someone you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from in to see that you know things will progress in a better way knowing that this isn&#39;t like the end of the world or is terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences of things at work worse or you know seem to be and of course is always in general I mean when you look at all the calamities in the world  you know most of those things aren&#39;t affecting us or the people that we know here  so that provides as perspective that you know can pull someone out of there  I don&#39;t necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment  well we have a good relationship day for the most part there are different levels of stress and Trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it is made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others some of not had  as much  experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way so it&#39;s always evolving and I walk and positivity as a lead of you know the way I respond to try and engender more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the very strong reactions are responses or any reactions that they may have  pardon I didn&#39;t I didn&#39;t hear you could you repeat  my mother different teachers friends  can you tell me about  well my mother is always been a very calm person for the most part easy-going even though she&#39;s experienced a lot of negativity I&#39;ve had teachers that have been very  talk positive and proactive and have you know taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring and just very close friends that you know I would see handling situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so  it depends for the most part it&#39;s you know pretty good it depends if I&#39;m dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know trying to get more hours in the day cuz me to get things done then you know it&#39;s less but in general I don&#39;t have a problem sleeping it&#39;s just if I make myself stay out stay up because there&#39;s more stuff that I want to get done  I&#39;ve been feeling okay but less you know stressful and general it goes in general cuz I&#39;ve got several projects that I&#39;m working on so but in general good  like I mean. In particular I mean I just seems less stressful as I get more stuff done and the stress comes from sometimes are being a lot more things to do in a short. Of time but you know reorganizing some of the things that need to be done you know can smooth it out  have you ever been to  no I haven&#39;t but I know it&#39;s something that a lot of say veterans are particular how people have  I have not know  well there&#39;s several I guess  and happiness comes in small or large things but in general everyday everyday everyday every moment to me is I mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know your happiness as far as big celebratory kinds of things I don&#39;t have big highs and lows like that I think it&#39;s something that should be on your Continuum you know it everyday it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be you know a moment shared with someone you know so  this should be an even on an even keel  as perseverant you know I will continue for sand and positive upbeat  is there anything you regret  maybe not doing things differently when I were younger or like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little bored differently but that&#39;s hard to say it&#39;s like okay as your kiddos or you can see you know you could have done some things differently  instead of buying the house I did what if you know waited and bought another one of me things like that  I would have made myself moved California sooner and I would have  instead of buying the house that I bought then if I known I would I would have you know the situation I have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know how that hides out you make the best decision that you can After Time  with the best information available you know after you have looked at several options  being independent and educated able to take care of myself  thanks for sharing your thoughts with me. Okay  albino  okay
683 very long  hussy  okay  it made it onto the camera so Jesus asked the other lady if she wanted me to put it on my forehead  there she is  how many different types of characters do you have  that you utilize different birds with him at the date today so everyone has been speaking to this young lady what&#39;s her name  what&#39;s real  so I&#39;m going to go ahead and start her up and then again when she says goodbye press that button okay  I&#39;m not a therapist  I&#39;m pleased  are you okay with this yes  not bad  open spaces for me coming from a different city it&#39;s just a completely new environment than that it was exciting  what are some things you don&#39;t  deeper than it being too many people there are also  less  considerate  it was probably due to the volume of people in it  you travel a lot  not in the form of sense but I work in transportation so I was on the road a lot doing a lot of covered a lot of territory over 800,000 miles and the last six years just in Southern California  what do you enjoy about traveling  the variety different environment  change of scenery  not isolated in what area  I&#39;d like to hear about one of your trips  in what respect  Hoag traveling cross-country coming out here I&#39;ve traveled across country from here from California to the Midwest Indiana Chicago area three times by vehicle car and it is just a profound experience the the the openness is vast and just you have to experience it how you can explain it  what you study at school  college or High School  well I studied in school I studied advertising and graphic design  and I&#39;m currently a student 20 years later again business management and cinematographer cinematography cinematography as well as a minor  all right  what&#39;s your dream job  a action star movie star action action adventure  you consider yourself more shy or outgoing shy outgoing because I have to be  why  people eat you up if you&#39;re not  distant  I reasonable I think I had as far as relaxing is concerned.  You know if I can get myself out there I do a little exercise  that&#39;s really not to relax that&#39;s really to unwind and get myself out of the tension that I might be in  probably 10 minutes ago non-verbal  tell me about a situation that you wish you would  marriage  did not  do all of my options before I chose and it was a bad decision  I love them but they didn&#39;t love me be careful of that  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  not being more available to my son  tell me about the hardest decision you&#39;ve ever had  wow that&#39;s a tough for me I&#39;ve been following the hardest decision  oh there was no decision in this this is but something that I&#39;d like to relate erased from my memory was in that accident with my brother a long time ago  I wish that had never happened to him  have you ever seen  yes  18 baby didn&#39;t think so at the time though  I just wanted to do something and that&#39;s what I did  are you happy  yes  not at first but in hindsight looking back yes  did you ever think  in a manner of speaking I was in Korea when they stomped one of my Majors to death and from that point forward everywhere we went we went fully loaded meaning armed with ammunition  no actual engagement With the Enemy though  or what other personality or whatever you call it  how is the weather  very  I never left it I was there as a worker  and just really was a pretty much the same as just changing jobs now  to do after the military  went back to the job that I had before when I was working with the u.s. steel  what is serving in the military change you  don&#39;t know if it did  if it did I have to say that gave me a  appreciation or the opportunity to work with stuff that I never probably would have worked with him so I travel a little bit around the world and we&#39;re working on the Korea and that may be more aware and appreciative of all of the things that are out there I got a chance to see him and touch him a little bit  how have you been feeling lately  depressed  no but I&#39;ll try to I  living environment where people are insecure so homeless and environment and there&#39;s a lot of stress that goes along with that if you&#39;re trying to do something that&#39;s a lot of you know you&#39;re beautiful you don&#39;t you&#39;re not sitting with the other people because the downtrodden and  that makes it stressful  yes  can you tell me about that  depression and frustration  with basically almost everybody that I&#39;ve tried to confide in  turned out to be treacherous and just not trustworthy or dedicated  recently  the same size if I get a lot of sleep in my own opinion but I think probably less focused  less able to focus but not getting sleep lately has been tough or go to sleep okay but I just wake up in a few hours then back to sleep you probably a lot of other things too  okay  have you ever been diagnosed with p  no  yeah that was one of the questions on there but it is it needs clarification and that&#39;s why I checked know on that yes but it was I was part of an experiment with taking interferon and ribavirin to try to cure hepatitis and those those two drugs cause depression so I was chemically depressed as opposed to clinically and as a difference so there was some the psychiatric help and some medication to help me get beyond that 311 months of treatment with that it was tough don&#39;t recommend it to anybody interferon is a killer don&#39;t do it  that treatment ended probably and all of the symptoms with it probably 3 to 5 years ago 3 years ago I think  nightmare has intense itching  thoughts of suicide and Vivid terrifying nightmares  that&#39;s interferon  interferon and ribavirin to drugs that they used to treat cancer and also in the treatment of hepatitis-c currently  in addition to a third drug that they used can&#39;t think of the name of it  how do you cope with them  well I seem to be okay now has skin damage my body broke out in a full-body rash  cause intense itching full full Ian golf the body for intense itching  almost made me jump out of window but I held on  the itching we&#39;re talkin about chemical cause being chemically induced as opposed to psychologically  okay  you still go to therapy now no  do you feel therapy  most worthless piece of crap I have a 20 out of 10 therapist that I talk to whoever said that the VA maybe to actually knew what they were doing or and then two were sincerely concerned about what they were doing the rest was just collecting a paycheck  show me more about that  well they were incompetent just asking foolish questions why I&#39;m even we were supposed to be talking about some of my personal things in life and she was playing little games like sitting a person purposely leave the person on the table to see your nose still use using Psychology 101 the book bad about through the by the Numbers at the way that she was taught to proceed with someone as opposed to actually knowing how to proceed with someone if they just it was it was it was a funny actually actually funny  sad  that is over but the changes since going to therapy  nothing you know all of that depression stuff kind of eased off and so I&#39;m back to trying to do the things that I was doing before I took that 11 months to go in that experiment  okay  when is the  in a long time  I usually get a little bit of that daily somewhere I get a little bit of happiness in here  just a little just enough to keep me saying I think  there are elected without being you know listing of the risk of being casciac my father but other than that of positive influence in my life have been many mostly the men that I worked with while working it was a younger man  there was some of the best the best work experience I&#39;ve had in my experience is my 30 or 40 years of working with the team and ship those men and it was probably the same kinship that you would gain from being in combat because it was dangerous work and these guys looked out for each other they took care of each other I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s pretty much the same way for a guy that experienced combat and the camaraderie that they had to have with each other because their lives were on the line  how do your best friend  giving  kind  nice  but I really enjoyed I get a lot of those could be going too many things I enjoy the moment you know driving  shopping for an enjoyment in something some kind of way everything I do  want to see my son  but many accomplishments most proud of in my life  been honest  you&#39;re welcome thank you  yes  you guys have a you guys have a ton of money for

605 remember to bring up a virtual human for a second here he&#39;s been here  I&#39;ll just let you know the way it&#39;s going to work as I&#39;m in a I&#39;m going to leave the room and she&#39;s just going to ask you some questions and then when she&#39;s done she&#39;s going to say goodbye and then you&#39;re going to press this button  got it awesome  so so cool  I just saw I heard in the background blurred on TV about the use of robots robots in with autistic children  got it  yes  born in Seattle Washington  yeah  the weather and that it&#39;s a little bit laid back some people say that in terms of musical beat LA to little bit behind the beat or just little laid back  it can be some people think that it&#39;s a little bit surface in terms of people&#39;s attitude I don&#39;t run into that that much I can&#39;t say that there&#39;s much I don&#39;t like these two days recently  yes or no  there&#39;s a meditation tape that has a fire burning in the background and then kind of stress reduction dialogue I listen to that  people being inconsiderate or unconscious about their effects on others  when people will drop trash without any regard and leave it for somebody else to pick up  I tend to internalize it and try and move past it  good  good question  it&#39;s been a long time that I can charge me to recall  I think as a family dispute we were just talking about a disagreement in terms of understanding out something was taking place and having different points of view  I just general education English math  most recently as a cost and risk analyst in the construction industry  probably these days we&#39;ll be riding  I have in the past I love travel  I love seeing new things and new experiences meeting new people  I&#39;m drawing a bit of a blank right now  I think reasonably close I&#39;m a little distant right now just cuz of circumstances  I want to say the Dalai Lama  oh just somebody who is an example of a way to move in the world and a compassionate manner  I could be better  yeah  no  nope  yes  probably what&#39;s now going on maybe well  yes  not just having a persistent low mood and wanting to find out what that it was about  yeah  yeah  Yap very much so  it&#39;s so I just  just an improvement in my ability to recognize some changes in my emotional state  it&#39;s improved my ability to move through various emotions as they occur  I&#39;m sleeping too much not getting the same pleasure out of things that I normally got pleasure out of  they can be sometimes  how disappointments if when things don&#39;t go as expected  process it go through and think about it and work my way through whatever issue it is  good  have I went can you repeat the question  no  next question  terrifically easy very easy  oh I can be irritable tired  oh I think  within the last couple of weeks I can&#39;t think of it the exact. Or occasion but  oh  are intelligent thoughtful  I try not to regret anything  that was bizarre
315 okay okay alright okay you  Inglewood California  yeah  no  that&#39;s okay  give me my girlfriend and my daughter  yes  are OKC okay cool  yes I do  well I&#39;m football recruiter so I travel all around the world to to sign different football players for sports management company  I&#39;m just the Independence about it being alone being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing you know it&#39;s great  I&#39;m I remember traveling to  and take them to clubs and this and that and we&#39;re not that type of organization  dishonesty I don&#39;t like when people are dishonest that really really really bothers me and not true not on its not real that that upsets me a lot  I tend to just  try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind when usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head in my head  I&#39;m okay with it at times but I can definitely be better  oh I already argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about our daughter in summer thing she&#39;s doing at school and she she wants to raise her one way and I think I want a razor a kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situation so I think different discipline is a big key in a kid&#39;s life and she she she was raised a little differently  I don&#39;t know just angry upset you know when you&#39;re an argument that&#39;s what you feel so you do and say things that that that bother you and you just go on with it  yeah a little bit  I don&#39;t know I just  that&#39;s the way I feel I don&#39;t know I can&#39;t really say this way I feel  a little a little  I don&#39;t know just  realness  honesty truth to spend straight out front  I&#39;m pretty clothes pretty clothes for my family  Oh Holy Night the subjective  they&#39;re raised different societies going to become even Wilder what the way the kids are raised and no discipline and and the things they&#39;re doing everything we we stay live and everything&#39;s inflated so much to where it&#39;s a skin to a point where it&#39;s getting out of hand I think kids these days to a certain extent are or much wilder than I was and and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and in all just education-wise is this I think it&#39;s just tough times for kids and in the way they act it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s ridiculous to me  I definitely like to watch sports I like to gamble I I like to travel but I can skate I like kind of like a a guy that likes to see different sites and go different places like that I&#39;m a big movie person so I like going to theater stuff like that  I&#39;m actually living it I always wanted to be in in some kind of sports industry and that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing now I just my goal was to get a little higher and a ladder and you know my own sports management company but I&#39;m doing pretty well for myself so I am happy yeah  no  no  no  it&#39;s okay that&#39;s it&#39;s pretty easy  irritated  Tire  I don&#39;t know it&#39;s been awhile it&#39;s been awhile couple weeks ago  how would you say  no not really  I think he would describe me as a stand-up guy I try to be a good loyal friend and  and I don&#39;t think you would describe me like that  school went to school grew up together I&#39;ve been knowing all my friends for 3 months on my life  there  a very close with my friends and I are very close together still at this age  I&#39;m honest loyal very loyal  I am a hard worker I think I am  tooth hurts and I&#39;m just not the average guy I&#39;m pretty much I&#39;m a different different breed I just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy  I don&#39;t know I just saw it but I was raised and high on my dad was kind of different and he didn&#39;t go with the In Crowd and I think I learned that from me and my Lawton and it&#39;s just it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of  same path I took  yes a lot of things I regret I regret  a lot of dishes in my life  yeah one  I actually let a a lady in my life goal years ago that I thought was my soulmate and we had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then not in that break I I start dating somebody else and I told her I&#39;m going to go my way and she go away I think that was a big a bad decision very bad decision  you&#39;ve done anything to avoid you have totally I think I should have took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of a  being so upset and moving forward  I just upset I tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded so I need to think a little more when I&#39;m upset  I don&#39;t know just  experience a Time been do you know making it making up for your mistakes and and then in  being better about different decisions after you made the mistakes  think a little harder by situation about situations and and things and the decisions that you make us think a lot longer and harder before you may come and I think the outcome will be in a little different today  my grandmother she&#39;s always been a positive influence she&#39;s a great black woman with old school  the ways of living so I think I have a bad at that to my life is a great woman  and baseball and yeah  I was a pretty good player I was a pretty good athlete growing up I was one of the top  and that started a future event and Athletics and that&#39;s what I wanted to do so I accomplished my girls who at the time was a great a great thing and still is a great thing it&#39;s a great accomplishment of my life  accomplishments being able to fry or if I&#39;m  have a goal or something I&#39;m supposed to do that week or that day and I compliment it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done and out the way I&#39;m supposed to do it in this in a timely fashion always with mega ball  being a positive role model right now for younger kids that&#39;s in our Sports Academy program I think as I got an older the thought process and the way I look at life is totally changed and I think I got a lot of kids can look up to me that I deal with now and say you know that somebody that that is is a pot of positive of going to my life  oh  couple days ago my football team where in the playoffs make the playoffs so I always makes me happy  thank you  I get by  finished
399 okay move this I&#39;m gonna move this behind your arm if you don&#39;t hi I&#39;m Ali thanks for coming in today  created to talk to people in the states  I&#39;m not a saint  are you okay  yes  pretty good  as far as my parents Ethiopia  yes  the beaches warm weather  the diverse environment  traffic  well I&#39;m currently in school I&#39;m studying African studies  how did you decide  I&#39;ve always been interested in African studies actually was wanted to help people and I figure that I can help them by trying to learn about it and going back to Africa making influence  kind of in-between I have my shy moments but then when I&#39;m around a group of people that Angela I&#39;m pretty outgoing  hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the  interacts I normally write or I go to the beach and just sit there and play My Guitar  pretty good I don&#39;t really  get angry or anything like that I tend to keep it in or try to release it by writing  when was the  I actually can&#39;t remember the last time I argue with someone  okay  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  all the people I&#39;ve hurt in the past  can you tell me about  well I&#39;ve  like cheated on people  hurt their feelings intentionally  some things I should have done that I regret now  well with my ex I could have ended it better so we could be on better terms now and I probably shouldn&#39;t have argue so much as try to instigate so many things I probably should have just let it go with the flow and just see how it turned out  hardest decision I&#39;ve ever had to make was  man I really don&#39;t know actually  having to see my dad go through surgery and see him suffer  well he had a tumor that had to get removed so it&#39;s just hard seeing him have to be in the bed and just be in the hospital when he really don&#39;t want to be there cuz he&#39;s a really live person and he&#39;d rather be running around and stuff like that but just saying I&#39;m stuck in bed and was just terrible  tell me about your relationship with your  me and my family are very close we don&#39;t I mean they&#39;ve always been there for me and I appreciate it but we&#39;ve never had that closed collection connection especially since they&#39;re foreign so they don&#39;t really understand where I&#39;m trying to come from having been grown up out in America so it&#39;s pretty different when it comes to a racial mean the cultural boundaries that we kind of Step each other each other&#39;s feet on but aside from that we have a decent relationship when we do speak to each other it does it kind of awkward but it&#39;s okay  I think they are out of control I think that they&#39;re learning things that they shouldn&#39;t know at this age I think that they&#39;re doing things they shouldn&#39;t be doing and I don&#39;t feel like enough people are telling them that they shouldn&#39;t be doing it I feel like they&#39;re being applauded by the media there being applauded by celebrities that they follow  and there&#39;s not enough being done about it and they&#39;re just getting lost  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep depends on the night some nights it&#39;s pretty hard some nights I fall asleep like a baby  what are you like when you don&#39;t say  usually creative actually when I can&#39;t sleep I&#39;ll just stay up and I&#39;ll write something or read a book and ideas will pop up  stuff like that is usually a good thing when I can&#39;t sleeps nothing really bad cuz I&#39;m having bad thoughts or anything like that  I&#39;m lately between a mix of good and bad I have my happy moments where I&#39;m at a Giants and I&#39;m alive and then some some days where I&#39;m just you know just sitting there just mellow thinking  not like my life self  I don&#39;t know his wife&#39;s been like that weighs have those UPS in those downs but they kind of balance each other out  no  the last time I felt really happy was  today  I&#39;m just from the moment I woke up it was a beautiful sunny day  I went to see you some friends we had a good time went to school had some good grades on some papers wrote A good essay so pretty accomplished and I feel like my days just a good day  my best friend would describe me as odd most people would describe me as odd  I see a lot of odd things I do odd things I&#39;m interested in things that most people aren&#39;t  Just Like Old literature revolutionary stuff  stuff about changing the world but through underground means  no I don&#39;t I don&#39;t live a life of regret  I never let fear stop you from doing anything  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  I&#39;m reading just hang out with some friends driving around finding something to do just go on an adventure  things you wish you could change about your  I don&#39;t wish I could change anything about myself I just wish I could build myself into the person that I&#39;m truly supposed to be  tell me about a time when someone made me feel really bad  this one time me and my best friend got into an argument and she pointed out all the things I&#39;ve done that I shouldn&#39;t have done all at one time how I&#39;ve hurt people have hurt her the ways I&#39;ve done them that were brutal and it just made me feel bad once I reflected on it all  my parents  can you tell me about  I mean although we don&#39;t see eye-to-eye the always bring me to this realization that I need at the end of the day although I never listen to him or I don&#39;t choose to listen to him once it happens I learned from it and I&#39;m like oh that&#39;s what my parents told me so I learned to trust them more and I learn to understand that they are wiser than me and that they do no more than me  I&#39;m not so much anymore I travel around the LA try to find you sights to see but as far as I don&#39;t travel outside  I&#39;m discovering new things discovering things you never knew were there or the Limitless possibilities  I discovered I like I enjoy discovering new people new cultures  new things that go against what&#39;s normal for us and for myself  a few days ago I just drove out to the middle of the desert and I just sat there and I just enjoyed all that the desert has to offer and it was just enjoyable  I felt free away from all this the city&#39;s needs buildings and it just felt nice to be out in the middle of nowhere at a completely random time  feel good  I&#39;m most proud that I&#39;ve always been different that despite how many people have told me that I&#39;m really weird rum otter I think weird things I&#39;ve always maintained my original mentality  sharing your thoughts with me  all right
401 where I am  try to see look like someone I know  no problem okay  okay alrighty  hi  are you okay  yes I&#39;m okay  I&#39;m good I&#39;m a little tired but I&#39;m good  Michigan I&#39;m from Michigan  a long time ago  then I laugh  once twice a year  compared to a  cold very cold  because I wanted to pursue my acting career  how did you do  well it wasn&#39;t a hard decision it was just it was the weather it was the opportunity it was the options more options  the driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy  blesse  besides the weather  I like that  things are more convenient  I like some of the people here  that are actually from home but  yeah and I just I like I like that it&#39;s a little late back  that&#39;s about it  I don&#39;t like the traffic I don&#39;t like  the gang violence in certain areas and I don&#39;t like  I like  maybe that&#39;s that&#39;s all I don&#39;t like  I don&#39;t know you know I like I don&#39;t like that it&#39;s so far away from home I wish I wish La was kind of Midwest I wish it wasn&#39;t so far from home  have a close relationship with my family it&#39;s a small immediate family is really small and we&#39;re closed my grandmother recently passed saw it some and adjustment right now but I&#39;m close to my family  okay  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer do you travel a lot  well I can&#39;t see your shoes but I do travel often  I do travel yes  I&#39;m getting there I like getting beer once I&#39;m at the wherever I&#39;m going I like to actually do the tourist thing get to know places and people  okay I will owe I went to I&#39;m France few years ago well many years ago and a little town called Carcassonne and was very  it was it was actually really fun but very much like a storybook as far as what I expected to seeing what I actually saw like what I remember that I really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there no windows in the buildings but they are the shutters that most places in the United States have inside of Windows they have them outside of the window there&#39;s no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool I like that  I&#39;m borderline sometimes I&#39;m shy sometimes I&#39;m outgoing and depends on who and what the situation is  music I turn on music I walk  through the neighborhoods now  I&#39;m pretty good at controlling my temper I&#39;m not a hothead at all  oh it was annexed roommate and it was about my loyalty as a friend  can you tell me about the  yeah pretty much gif  I thought that because I wanted my rent what she agreed to pay that I was not being a good friend that I should just let her live for free  that wasn&#39;t going to happen  so you know the Loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway even after she didn&#39;t pay me so that&#39;s a friend I could have kicked her out I didn&#39;t  she laughed at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but she could have  could have been a bad situation but there was an argument there a real a real one  I wish I had handled that situation differently and follow my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily and gotten my money up front that&#39;s what I wish I had done and I just I didn&#39;t my mind told me to go along with it  no my my told me to get the money up front but I didn&#39;t  so  the hardest decision  I think I have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like  maybe leaving home  leaving home when I was years ago when I was like 18  yeah  I felt like I was abandoning my family that&#39;s what I felt  but I&#39;m very encouraged me to go on and live my life  something that I could erase from my memory  probably a friend who I was on  dating I would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when I told him my grandmother was ill  how is your day  I&#39;m it&#39;s easy if I&#39;m busy all day and I&#39;m really really tired but actually my mind spins so  it&#39;s not that easy actually it&#39;s not that easy  I have to because I have to  be exhausted  I have to be exhausted  to be exhausted now it&#39;s not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long  irritable  up and down  I&#39;ve been up and down like sometimes I&#39;ve  then excited and anxious and on the other side I&#39;m like  what am I doing  I need triggered by something  you&#39;re just a nature sister want to make some things happen  some goals  getting certain kind of work and  having a certain amount of income and  just taking care of myself do you know the way I think I should take care of myself just the physical stuff  eating right and everything  yeah I have  can you tell me about  sometimes I have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what I need to be focused on in the moment and I&#39;m conscious of that him like of all the things that keep popping up in my head why am I thinking about that  I let them happen and then I try to think about other things and FaZe it out pops back up I phase it out  I know  now  when the roommate moved out I was really happy when she finally left  tell me how you spend your ideal weekend  I&#39;m probably reading and maybe go I&#39;ll go dancing that would be ideal I can go dancing salsa dancing and yeah  what are some things you wish you could change about your  my ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it  really badly  I don&#39;t know if I have a time to someone has ever made me feel really badly I don&#39;t feel bad about much  as courageous  I will be at in a nutshell  in general  I regret not making some different decisions when I was younger as far as moving forward as far as career stuff and relationship things I wish I had done some things earlier in my life that I&#39;m doing now  I&#39;m really going after some of my personal goals and  deciding to actually be in a relationship that&#39;s long-term and yeah I wish I had done that earlier  20 years ago I would have given given myself the advice to continue with my schooling beyond what I did and  to be more

405 essential let you know and then you can let me know okay thanks  thanks  go ahead and move his cord behind you didn&#39;t get any way  hi hello  are you okay with this  yes  okay not too bad  I&#39;m from Chicago South Side  I&#39;m back in 1978 when I was 18  lately not much maybe once every two or three years  compared to the letter A  it&#39;s totally different you know horrible weather and  it&#39;s just a whole different atmosphere  let&#39;s see my mother had moved to Africa  I graduated from high school and I had a friend down here so I just thought well let me try la  very easy actually yeah I loved it from the moment I got off the airplane  number one the weather son is very important to me so I love the weather  I don&#39;t know just kind of a more laid-back atmosphere variety  of people  and now it&#39;s my my Homebase you know my friends that are family  that&#39;s how I like my family is here now  I guess the small hug earthquakes  traffic  just basic things like that really  I don&#39;t currently but I did throughout my life I travel quite a lot  I just seeing seeing other cultures and seeing more history and meeting people and  just fun at the fun of it as well  let&#39;s see what one trip I went to England  Ireland and Scotland and France all in you know one trip  so that was a nice variety  I guess you could say probably skiing in val de saire France  that was fun I&#39;m glad I got to do that  that&#39;s great  do you consider yourself more shy  I&#39;m kind of shy by Nature I&#39;ve tried to grow out of being shy so I&#39;m not fully shy but I was always an extremely shy child  but now here in Culver City this is my environment and I I guess you could say I&#39;m not really shy and in my hometown of Culver City  I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  to relax I like to just curl up in my bed and read my book take a nap watch TV sometimes on the couch in the living room just you know stay at home and kind of vegetate  pretty good yeah my tempers pretty level  probably with my husband  and  I can&#39;t remember the moment what it was about  okay  tell me about your relationship with you  well when you say my family do you mean  my family from childhood or my current family  okay well I guess my current family comes to mind I have two daughters and my relationships pretty good it&#39;s okay with them but they&#39;re teenagers which you know going they&#39;re going through a lot of hormones and they can be kind of bitchy and  and but I have hope that you know they&#39;ll grow out of bed and soon someday we&#39;ll have a really good relationship  and then there&#39;s the husband which  like I guess I could face soon-to-be-ex-husband hopefully soon we need to get a divorce but we&#39;re still together due to financial reasons  and yeah yeah so that that&#39;s not good relationship with the husband but  but since we have determined that we need to divorce  we don&#39;t expect anything out of each other so we don&#39;t argue as much so that&#39;s good  well  I guess our marriage  I wish I had noticed early on that  you know it was like way off from what I thought it was  how do you say oh my God  hardest decision  I guess leaving my first husband that was pretty hard  well you know we were married and I wasn&#39;t content I guess you could say and  I kind of just gave up on our relationship and now that I look back I think it&#39;s because  I want children and he would have been happy to never have any and so since I didn&#39;t have a father it was very important that I create children with someone who really wanted to be a father and so I was kind of at an age where I needed to start thinking about having children yet I was with someone who really was not into it so that I think that&#39;s one maybe the core reason why I was not content and I just felt like this marriage isn&#39;t going to work n so you know we went to therapy and everything and he did not want to break up and  and I had to leave him because I just wasn&#39;t happy and that was that was very hard cuz  yeah  felt like I was hurting him which which I was him he survived he got over and now he&#39;s married with two kids but it was hard to leave him  tell me about Nevada or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  something I wish I could erase from my memory have to think about that  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something well  yeah there&#39;s some  I guess it&#39;d be nice to erase from my memory a recent I&#39;m not resend but an event in my  recent adulthood here in Culver City where one of my best friends  betrayed me by back years ago when my husband first got into real estate she and her family were growing and they really need a larger home and  we just assumed that you know that they would use my husband as their agent supposed to sell their current home current at the time and purchase a new home  and as it turned out they surprised us and had been talking to this other local agent and yeah that was devastating  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been betrayed like that so I wish I could erase that not cuz now you know this was back when the kids were really young  and  my daughter at the time my youngest daughter was let&#39;s say  6 Maybe  maybe five anyway her and my best friend&#39;s daughter are the same age they were born within days of each other we were pregnant together and they were really tight those two little girls and they ended up not going to the same elementary school so they didn&#39;t get to hang out during those years but every time we run into them in the neighborhood are they run into each other at a summer camp or something they were just so connected they were just you know like two peas in a pod even those her their moms weren&#39;t talking to each other anymore so now they&#39;re 13 and 14 and they&#39;re in middle school together and they&#39;re still very connected in fact she she for the first time spent the night at our house last night with my daughter and another girl and it&#39;s just a little awkward you know cuz now these girls are becoming really good friends  your friends and yet I still have this  bad memory of what her  her mom did to to me  that was about 1:10  about 8 years ago  I tried it I try to ignore it and put it out of my head which have been able to  in recent years  but obviously it still comes up  anyway that was that  not that easy I do sometimes get a decent night&#39;s sleep but sometimes it&#39;s hard to get to sleep and most of the time I wake up and can&#39;t get back to sleep but or I finally get back to sleep and then it&#39;s almost time to get up you know that that difficult thing  well the waking up in the middle of the night is definitely triggered by having to go to the bathroom and then  you know it&#39;s not always that easy to get back to sleep and then I wake up again to go to the bathroom  so I guess that&#39;s the trigger as far as getting to sleep having a hard time there I don&#39;t know I think there&#39;s just too much on my mind running through my mind and the day I feel like I haven&#39;t accomplished enough during the day so  it&#39;s hard for me to just go to sleep when I&#39;m supposed to guess  well I&#39;m kind of used to it now so I just go on to the day probably looking looking tired and  like I&#39;m kind of used to feeling tired I just do what I need to do and sometimes if I&#39;m able to if I&#39;m at home and don&#39;t have huge commitments yeah I might just like I said earlier just take a nap or something read my book watch TV whatever  lately have I been feeling  kind of down  on myself down on life  well I have this pending need for separation / divorce  I&#39;m worried that I made a lot of mistakes with my girls now they&#39;re teenagers you know on the verge of adulthood  and so I worried that you know I did all kinds of things wrong with their guidance in their early childhood and now it&#39;s too late  like I missed out on a lot of things  and yeah I need a job I&#39;m unemployed I don&#39;t know what I want to do with my life I know I want to do something and I just wish you know I never did finish college unfortunately because I was traveling and stuff  so I regret that extremely  and I need to get a job and be able to take care of myself cuz I need to  divorce and move on with my life so now I forget what the original question was but that&#39;s the state part of the state of Mo  no  yes  well  the first time or or or recently  the first time I guess was you know when I was in my early twenties I was just a little upset about constantly that was another breakup I had to make back then I was  in my early twenties and I needed to break up with my boyfriend but again it was very upsetting cuz I  you know it&#39;s hard because he didn&#39;t want to break up and I feel like I was hurting him and I didn&#39;t understand this feeling I was really upset  how did that was my first time having depression so I didn&#39;t really recognize it as depression but I went somehow I had the  knowledge or the I was able to take myself to a psychiatrist I remember I paid for her by the hour and she prescribed Xanax to just help relax me  and so I guess that helped me get through that and then I&#39;ve had depression throughout the years just so you know little bits here and there for various reasons such as I guess it&#39;s usually a relationship you know  yeah so the most recent time I was diagnosed and put on meds that was probably about 2 years ago  no  money and I don&#39;t have insurance otherwise yeah I&#39;d be happy to go to therapy anything that might help  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  last time I felt really happy  I don&#39;t know I guess maybe  when my children were born  I guess happy I just you know I always wanted children so it&#39;s nice  to have them  that&#39;s I don&#39;t know that&#39;s all I can remember of that and I guess I don&#39;t remember the good times too well I remember the bad times  something you did recently that you really enjoy  something I did that I really enjoyed  well  that&#39;s the way I am  Friday night I went to a friend&#39;s house and met up with five other girlfriends and we  we created vision boards and talked and had dinner at one of their house that was that was fun  we get to  stay in college get my degree  get therapy trying to become happy  yeah try to figure out things earlier in life  like  yeah  stay in college and and mainly I think the mean and what it all boils down to no matter what your depressed about it seems like  as soon as the saying goes in the  songs go you know it&#39;s all about money the world revolves around money in  having none that in itself is for depressing so besides relationships and different things that have happened in your life having no money as you know it&#39;s like you can&#39;t even try to fix anything because you don&#39;t have the money to fix it so with that in mind I would definitely advise myself to get my college degree and to get a job and stick with it don&#39;t quit to go traveling and I&#39;ll just stick with a job sick with a company build up your seniority keep your benefits  and build up some knowledge or some expertise in some sort of filled yeah that would have been my biggest piece of advice to myself  not much  I guess  just my daughter&#39;s you know there are two beautiful daughters and  I&#39;m proud and glad that I was able to have children some people  aren&#39;t even able to do that you know and they try so hard or they look back on their life and they wish they had done it so that&#39;s the one thing I mean I wanted five children and I always wanted a boy which I never had but I guess that&#39;s the biggest thing I can think of to be proud of  having my two daughters  I&#39;m a very loyal  friend and person that&#39;s why when that friend betrayed me I was so devastating  yeah very loyal very  happy was I going to say I was going to say happy go lucky I don&#39;t know where that came from very I meant to say friendly and caring and  yeah I care about people  and I&#39;m interested in people  and I care about animals as well actually that&#39;s another thing I&#39;m proud of proud of being a vegetarian  yeah so my daughters and being vegetarian and I&#39;m a vegetarian because I really care about feelings of other beings not only humans but animals to in  you know I don&#39;t think that animals should be tortured and live a torturous life just so we can eat them  so what was the question  remember the question  okay  you&#39;re welcome by  I did need the tissue one time so that&#39;s good  the other sister
483 sure good I guess  New Orleans Louisiana  a 2005  I used to go back often but not much anymore  just think happened  well I guess you&#39;re not programmed with Trina happened in 2005  not really  tell me about that  where to begin just has different culturally have a different culture out here it&#39;s just a different place  it&#39;s it&#39;s bike-friendly  Louisiana isn&#39;t New Orleans for that matter really isn&#39;t now they&#39;re trying to be but it just it isn&#39;t that successful  the drivers the crazy  not really kind of but not much anymore  don&#39;t have the money kind of broke  just being able to go on an adventure  I once went to Comic-Con on a on a bicycle like on a 3-wheel bike  and that was pretty fun kind of scary and dangerous new I got killed it was scary  traveling or just in general  I got to say  I got to say we were we were heading out of  we were getting off the PCH and going into  Laguna I&#39;m going to have this really steep hill and on Sundays it&#39;s full of traffic  and I remember going down  that the hill and my brakes weren&#39;t working and I was trying to hit my brakes and try and hit my brakes and they just they wouldn&#39;t quick and I was like oh God and I&#39;m going to throw you all bikes on larger than most bikes and I&#39;m like zipping in between like gridlock traffic going downhill  unable to break  and I&#39;m going down  and suddenly there&#39;s the car that veers right into the century where I&#39;m trying to go so I turn sharply  in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic  looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any breaks and like not managing to keep my bike from  rolling which is painful when your bike rolls kind of hurts a lot  so yeah  noted  various different things at Anthropologie visual effects  kind of weird but yeah  I&#39;ve always had a fascination with film and  I think the white people do things and go about things as fascinating  just as like that the mob mentality of people  especially  dream job  huh I have no idea  did the job I guess  I consider myself more outgoing  you know I&#39;ve never been afraid of what people think of me  why people don&#39;t like people I don&#39;t know  I&#39;m not I&#39;m not afraid of what they think  I&#39;m more concerned with like the people I know and what they think of me I guess so being outgoing just doesn&#39;t really affect me  play video games listen to music  yeah read books I like reading books and drawing reading books drawing playing video games  did I forget anything sleeping  I like sleeping that&#39;s fine  not good  and high school a I shove somebody&#39;s head through a locker  yeah  yeah that that&#39;s not good don&#39;t ever shut someone&#39;s head into a locker that&#39;s a great way to get suspended  I don&#39;t know  things like that just getting into fights  like a serious argument  I guess like  argument over  over  I guess over like a like viewpoints on like that control and gun control laws  I mean  I was like yesterday evening  it was  it was an argument about you know gun control regulation I mean it doesn&#39;t really affect me personally but that was like the last argument I got into I want you specified I think  my entire life  I have  about two years ago I broke up with like as everyone calls her my evil Acts  and  yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad I mean  I think I&#39;ve calmed down a lot since then  what is a person as a whole but I mean I was angry and stuff I think I like one riding my bike for like a hundred plus miles in a senior day and I was in a ton of pain like later in the evening I got home I was like oh God like I can barely walk  and yeah I think running off in like going on like extreme cycling spree was not good but is better than like  eating too much in like just over eating cuz I was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like I wasn&#39;t physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve had a singular hard decision I&#39;ve ever had to make because  my my biggest thing  and why don&#39;t you know don&#39;t regret  don&#39;t regret the things you do  just regret the opportunities you&#39;ve messed and that&#39;s like had to come with me that&#39;s like hats I&#39;ve had to like learn that in the past like 2 years  like two years ago I totally just cannot grasp that concept and answer your question I think thinking about it the hardest decision I&#39;ve had to make is  I&#39;d say  probably  probably to break up with my ex probably  where do I begin  my ex was not a good person and just in any way shape or form of the word  she did some things they wasn&#39;t entirely comfortable with  just took that the people around her and to me  I  you know they say You&#39;re supposed to give forgive people  for making mistakes or doing things  and I just I think there&#39;s some things you can&#39;t forgive people for no matter how hard you try and I think there&#39;s something that wants done  but they can&#39;t be undone they just their through the way that they are  and I think I think after what she did  I like I just did things just fell apart after that it just to spite us trying  I just didn&#39;t work out I mean  I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t really want to talk about exactly what happened  emojis  oh man  erase for my memory or just erased from ever happening  huh I don&#39;t you know that&#39;s hard  Katrina just the experience of Katrina for starters  my ex I guess between those two it&#39;s it&#39;s going to hurt at that actually rather lean towards Katrina cuz that was just that that was not  I mean I guess you don&#39;t exactly know about it but  in 2005  does giant storm hit  New Orleans Louisiana killed a whole bunch of people level the town  and I&#39;m also at a friend&#39;s during the storm  I mean I&#39;m kind of getting over it but it&#39;s still it&#39;s still there and I think  I don&#39;t know I mean  you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there&#39;s just there&#39;s nothing the only thing you can do is just think that was like a freak accident will never happen again I live in LA and you know  earthquakes can happen I just think I&#39;d rather rather know that it&#39;s coming then not know it&#39;s coming  have you ever been diagnosed with PTSD  yes  yeah  depression it&#39;s record multiple times  that&#39;s no surprise first time I was diagnosed was in Middle School  which would have been  ten well ten between 10-12 years ago I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know whenever I was in the sixth grade that&#39;s my first was told that I was depressed  as far as PTSD goes  post-katrina  and then you know  post-katrina moster that was the big thing  I guess having been diagnosed previously is being depressed and still being in high school  it kind of wasn&#39;t I wasn&#39;t really seeking help its kind of I got that kind of got into my high school and then we&#39;re like here&#39;s help cuz we know you&#39;re going to need it  and I was like oh well thanks I didn&#39;t really ask for it but okay I&#39;ll take it  you know  just kind of happened  no not not anymore  what&#39;s a good question you know I was like I&#39;m not going to do this anymore  sometimes  sometimes it&#39;s a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and  you know it&#39;s kind of well I&#39;m feeling fine right now but  ask me in 2 hours and who knows you know  I guess  it&#39;s helped me understand that some of the things that just happened just happened and to just get on and move along with your life  essential just like carrion you know things will happen carry on  tell me about the last time you felt really happy  wow  I was  I was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out  for starters I mean you can&#39;t see when I walked in but I&#39;m walking with cane right now cuz I got hit by a car recently and make my leg better  what&#39;s a chainsaw over there that way but anyway  I don&#39;t know I make myself less fat  how to make it so I don&#39;t feel the incessant need to sleep 14 hours a day  ohm kiss when you sleep like more than 10 hours a day it&#39;s just some productive if you waste too much time with guy friends who are like oh you know I feel rejuvenated after 6 hours and I&#39;m like how do you do that I have to sleep with 12 hours to feel good when you can sleep 6 you know like in an crunch time you know you can get away with for I have to get away with seven or eight you know  like that that&#39;s my crunch time sleep schedule 8 hours it&#39;s just I don&#39;t know I oversleep but I like sleeping to  I&#39;m just the oversleeping part I don&#39;t like so much  utterly insane in a good way I&#39;d really insane in a good way I guess  like that they would also say like you know  that there are times where I might seem like an asshole and I&#39;m not really an ass-whole I just you know  I just have issues like everybody else specifically I have Asperger&#39;s so that&#39;s a form of autism  I&#39;m not just kind of makes life awesome  did also say I&#39;m flamboyant an eccentric cuz I totally am  I just  I don&#39;t know I figure I&#39;m still alive so I should live because I&#39;m still alive  do you know who knows how long I&#39;m going to be live for so I should you know  Live While I&#39;m Alive and just  go out and do stuff not  not sit and be calm  except when I&#39;m reading  I like reading  stop fucking up know it&#39;s kind of messed up  I think I would have told myself at the time  because I have known my my evil acts I&#39;ve known her since like I was like six and she was five I think 10 years ago I would have grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl  don&#39;t trust her she can&#39;t be trusted and more importantly don&#39;t  don&#39;t let your guard down around her cuz show show exploit that  I don&#39;t mean like physically let your guard down not mentally  yeah don&#39;t date or just don&#39;t do it it&#39;s not worth it it&#39;s not worth the trouble it&#39;s not worth the pain  it&#39;s not worth it  the fact that I&#39;m still alive Maybe  yeah I don&#39;t know cycling the Comic-Con I was pretty proud of that pretty proud that I managed to do it  just  I don&#39;t you know I don&#39;t really know I don&#39;t really use the term pride and I really feel Pride  I&#39;m just it&#39;s more like the fact that I&#39;m still alive I&#39;m proud to be alive  I don&#39;t know if that makes me humble or just insane  who knows  do I press the button now I&#39;ll buy  okay  to who do do do do do  by the way her eyes are really creepy  just saying that  it&#39;s just the way that they say that they have the uncanny

I like the scenery and idea going from place to place  I&#39;d like to hear about one of your trips  sounds like when I go to La I like to get on the train on the buses meet different people  it&#39;s like an adventure to me  now I got on the bus and I talked to somebody that I knew for a while very nice person  English mouth  Industrial  French a little bit of French  right now I&#39;m unemployed  what&#39;s your dream job  my dream job says sit at a desk to do paperwork or something like that  do you consider yourself more shy or outgoing  I&#39;m pretty pretty much outgoing  well we&#39;re not so close right now but when I was younger we were pretty close  well I watch DVDs and then I play dominoes  and I walk a little dad  I&#39;m pretty decent with controlling my temper on the average  when was the  LOL, I&#39;ll get with somebody it was about another person that has about how you was carrying a life on how they were going is like they didn&#39;t really care a whole lot about themselves and I tried to comfort them and let him know life is a beautiful thing  that you wish you would have  and sometime when I get  sometime I get upset sometimes when I shouldn&#39;t and I stop myself I catch myself sometime when I start getting upset and realize it is not that serious and I need to move on to something more pleasant and something more positive  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  well I feel guilty about when I was homeless and I was in a sort of taking advantage of other people being homeless is like I was and I didn&#39;t need to be homeless  tell me about the  the hardest decision  let me see  whether I wanted to  clean up my life or dive doing drugs and alcohol that was a hard decision  something I could erase my memory  when I spent a lot of money and I didn&#39;t respect enough to keep it  have you ever  yes I have  I was almost 19 years old  because I want to do something different and I thought it was a challenge for me  do I have a volunteer and I went in  yes I am only have one regret I didn&#39;t stay in for 20 years  okay  did you ever see combat no I never did see combat you can close to it but didn&#39;t quite said  yeah it&#39;s Fairy Tail was okay then it was kind of hard for me to adjust to the time frame of getting to work on time waking up on time or no  what did you do after the military  where am I I got a job my first job was working for JCPenney&#39;s in Palm Springs  well that made me a little tougher and then again it was a little stressful too  that&#39;s okay  lately I&#39;ve been feeling pretty good about myself  well I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not living on the streets anymore happy I got a few good friends and they make my day sometime and most of all I kind of make my day and think positive  have you noticed any changes in her behavior lately  off and on yeah sometime I get a little bit depressed then I come out of that and then  I am a little bit disappointed to and myself cuz I could have been better off than I am now but I could have been a lot worse to  it&#39;s very easy no but I have no problem with sleep  what do you like  what am I like when I don&#39;t sweat a little cranky but I kind of like  but it fades away during the daytime  no but I&#39;ve been diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar  okay  have you been diagnosed with  yeah that investor has a lot to do with my schizoaffective bipolar 2 and sometime I get pretty depressed  but not that often  I&#39;d say about your pussy  can 11 years ago  my symptoms hallucination I had two shakes  my mind was Russian I couldn&#39;t concentrate on anything  and also was depressed  are they tracking  sometime I think people are some people should treat me better than they do now and they don&#39;t now I get a little depressed about that too  yeah I have friends sometime they currently  do little things a guy that gets on my nerves but I try to look above that rise above it and my Day become better when I do that  how do you cope with them  I tried to call for you and with what kind is and forgiving this  I try not to dwell on things  yeah I&#39;m not normally a positive thinking person I try to be most of the time I don&#39;t know it kind of helps my situations  say again I can understand what you&#39;re saying  you still go to therapy  yes I do I&#39;ll go twice a month  I go to meeting the two groups studies for my diagnostic scanner and I get to see my case manager  you feel therapy in Haysville yes I do I think it helps me stay calm cool Collective  well I figured if I wasn&#39;t on my medication I&#39;d be a lot worse off and then I try to do exactly what the doctor tell me to do it so I can be all right  well I used to I used to be scared of and I used to get angry real easy light but now I don&#39;t do that  so happy helps me out a lot and he keeps me with a level head most of the time  when was the last time  when&#39;s the last time I felt really happy  on my birthday I was very happy on my birthday  Houston has been deposited influence in your life  I got a friend named Eugene Washington he&#39;s a good person like when I was in the hospital tonight I was ill and I had my operation and then he need to help me out and go to the grocery store by make food come and visit me to see how I&#39;m doing he took care of me and I appreciate that very much for now  they know me almost better than I know myself but they just drive me as impatient sometime  I try to understand would you know what they&#39;re trying to say to me  so I can be more thoughtful  I went fishing Saturday and I really did enjoy myself I had a good time  fishing is my favorite sport  what am I proud of in my life  I volunteered in the Marine Corps and I did my part and I was happy I didn&#39;t do my part as well as I should have when I was talking about earlier about getting out early I should have stayed in 17 more years and I could have been retired  thanks for sharing your thoughts  you&#39;re very welcome  goodbye  you heard me  we had a pretty serious conversation going I&#39;m sure you going to play it back in here  it was it was different
370 when she&#39;s done  hi I&#39;m Ali thanks for coming in today I was created to talk to people and it&#39;s safe  and please  are you okay  yeah  I&#39;m doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you  I&#39;m from here in La I grew up in the San Fernando Valley  yeah  well I like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat I like the outdoor opportunities I grew up close to the hills so I did a lot of hiking and camping is pretty close by have gone snowboarding I like it the familiarity I think you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a big city and you know I&#39;m pretty familiar with the having lived here for so long that I haven&#39;t said like that too  I&#39;m probably the number one thing that everybody says I don&#39;t like Gothic that don&#39;t like being stuck in traffic I don&#39;t like  the long commute Stephen Nina for short distances  danonino gets really hot in the summer a time so you know that I could stand it being a little slightly cooler when I gets to its peak Peak heat but that&#39;s fine  well my dream job that&#39;s a great question I asked  I think my dream job would probably be you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of that profit off it you know maybe gainful Employment Office traveling but it&#39;s almost an unrealistic dream since I don&#39;t know if I would actually want to do that but if  if I had to pick some kind of dream existence he of traveling getting paid to travel and meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun  well I like like a mention what I like by the way I like trying different kinds of food different Cuisine so I think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people sing different ways of life would be that is what I like about traveling I like experiencing new things I think that&#39;d be nice so you know despite the fact I said I&#39;d like the familiarity of La there&#39;s also funded discovering you think so I think when I travel that&#39;s that&#39;s what I like to do just checking things out  I would like to be you know if I could make a living doing that that be great  one of my trips okay well let&#39;s see the the last trip I took  I think of what one one more exciting trip  well my my family is from Eastern Europe so one of the trips I took with my parents when I was fourteen was I went to Austria Hungary and Romania and you know getting to see some of those old guy been a few times before but I was when I was little so I don&#39;t really have too much primary plus I didn&#39;t really process things quite the same as when I was kind of more of age so I got to see you know my family is old you know Hometown you know that we have a family like tomb so I got to see that than just these old buildings and just a different way of life I really like that you know seeing my parents old friends you know and so that was pretty funny was very different I was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment do you know I left them know the school year so is just like going from no Suburban America to traveling around kind of you know taking these old trains and Sandy&#39;s castles and he&#39;s old like hundreds of the year old Townsend  I don&#39;t know if it was for everyone you know I don&#39;t know it would be great for everybody by I really enjoyed it  but it&#39;s the best  oh that&#39;s that&#39;s a good question I do I probably one of the things I do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom I used to watch the office a lot so I kind of know when that&#39;s on so I&#39;ll turn that on you know just kind of zone out a little bit too you know if you like it characters in and hearing the jokes that are still funny for some reason or maybe like eating some kind of comfort food you know I try not to eat too much fast food at all but like in and out I really like going there so if I have to unwind once every few months maybe I&#39;ll do that or I really like to read especially like I&#39;ll read the day&#39;s events you know that that really relax with me for some reason even if it&#39;s reading about something some conflict going on some of the World II Soul I&#39;ll read the headlines and I really like to know what&#39;s going on that kind of centers me so I really enjoy that that&#39;s the way I do to relax  I would say I&#39;m pretty great at it at all though I don&#39;t I think my nature makes it pretty easy pranks that pretty easy I don&#39;t I don&#39;t get very upset easily at all so it&#39;s not much of a challenge to control my temper at  yeah I don&#39;t really have anger issues that it&#39;s difficult for me to get angry so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really have much trouble with that at all  last time I argued with somebody was probably  I don&#39;t even know I a mean small disagreement see no I might have had with family or friends about things but just a full-on argument I got I can&#39;t even remember it&#39;s been years I did I don&#39;t really argue too much I try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my in my personal life I don&#39;t really see anything to be gained by and I kind of naturally repel away from it so I don&#39;t have much to say about arguing  what&#39;s something you feel guilty about  I feel guilty about I would say that you know something sometimes I don&#39;t really  I feel like I may be having made the most of my potential yet in life I think that I could definitely do more despite the fact I work a lot I feel like I there&#39;s always more opportunity out there that they were missing I feel like you know sometimes down time I feel a little bit guilty about that because there&#39;s always something that I could be doing that I&#39;m not even if it&#39;s just putting away the laundry that that&#39;s been I took out of the dryer that&#39;s been sitting there or  running late I really don&#39;t like running late although it happens more than I&#39;d like to write I don&#39;t know why I feel guilty about that I don&#39;t like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like you&#39;re my time is not more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true  tell me about new bed or something that you wish you could erase from your memory  nothing immediately comes to mind I well the last car accident I got into it was a few years ago I guess I wish it hadn&#39;t happened. I wish I could erase it from my memory but I ate was driving in rush-hour traffic and you know it I thought the cars in front of me where we&#39;re going you know at least for a little Mia 10-15 feet but it turns out that that stops so you know slow rear end collision but it was still very important I was just you know I just felt like I was paying attention one second and the next second you know I was just like reaching for something on the lights in the passenger seat and then I ate I smacked into the car in front of me in  I wish I had a theft and absolutely I know it&#39;s a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad enough for me financially any of the people I got into an accident while we were fine but I was you know they they didn&#39;t ask for anything beyond repairing the damage is but that it was just a horrible timing so I wished I hadn&#39;t happened  but that sucks it did suck I&#39;ve over now but I suck  okay  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep well I&#39;m a pretty good sleeper although I naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job allows me fortunate pretty flexible schedule but on the same token I wish I could wear like hardwired to go to sleep earlier because I just I wind up staying up till 1 or 2 every night and it&#39;s just too late you know even though I can get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it&#39;s not always at night time you know half of my sleep is like in the head of early daylight hours I wish I were more able to sleep. Go to sleep at like 10 or 11 and then sleep in or wake up earlier as opposed to  going to sleep later and waking up later  I&#39;m pretty feeling pretty good. I&#39;ve been I have no complaints physically and you health-wise I feel good you&#39;re my relationships with my my family and friends are good  everything is great so far I had absolutely no no real complaints as far as how I&#39;m feeling. Myself or anything like that  no no I&#39;ve been fairly consistent with my behavior in my thoughts I think that  everything is been been pretty okay pretty said he no no nothing traumatic nothing kind of resurfacing for the past nothing of the sort has this happened there is happening  no  no  well I think there&#39;s plenty of things everybody regrets yeah yeah there&#39;s there&#39;s plenty of things  in my life yeah like I said I I do regret you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days he know I there&#39;s a pretty of time in my early twenties where I I didn&#39;t work for a while I just I hung out with a lot of friends yeah I guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us work we just you know we we got high everyday or it seemed like every day I don&#39;t know it was just this is kind of like a throwaway. Of my life  advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  I would say that  it&#39;s important to  210 gauge with the world I think I I think I kind of dropped off in the world a little bit I think it&#39;s also I would say that it&#39;s important to  recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what what kind of potential do you know if you try tivities that you can expect from the people you surround yourself with I think that I would say also that kind of try to focus on what I wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking while you know things will work out which eventually they do but I think that you know there&#39;s a bit of lost time with that approach is kind of fatalistic and I think that I would say you know just try to concentrate you know you know not not everyone works on the same schedule in life is not a race but I would say that it was it important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you no idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kind of waiting and thinking of things will fall into place  tell me about a time when someone made you  well I I  I guess some people I I don&#39;t especially  take it even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason I think that at least myself I sort of have things figured out although I am not sure I&#39;m wrong about that so I think just maybe in terms of like a group work. Done professionally or academically you know when when some of my work is kind of picked apart or were scrutinized I&#39;d I don&#39;t deal well with that and I had taken more personally than I should  show me about a year-and-a-half ago I was working on a research project at work and somebody with much less those three of us working on something and then they brought in another pair of eyes just to go over it in those somebody just out of God College you know  went over what we have done and you know it&#39;s just kind of rewording things and it seems just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and I kind of took first offense to that just because I thought I had a lot more experience and more education and it was unnecessary that you know I thought the whole thing was a waste of time and you know I just  I didn&#39;t think that she was somebody that was qualified to attend this earlier we do all our work or or even to not not to redo it but to 2 edited or to proofread I guessed it to make any kind of you know qualitative changes I I just thought that it was a really bad idea and I thought that you know I should have viewed it this way but I thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know it was kind of like an affront to us would work on it on this project but you know it wasn&#39;t our call  most memorable experiences  I guess the first thing that comes to mind is one of my the first real trip I took by myself I took the the Amtrak to to New Mexico and I was out there exploring things for about 10 days on my own so that was kind of the longest. Time up till that point and I was in my 23 maybe at the time that I had really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone I was in parts of New Mexico where there&#39;s no cell phone reception at the time  it is very memorable because I was on it on my own I feel like I was really you know exposed to the things I wouldn&#39;t have seen if I had to had traveling companions it was a lot of fun  tell me about the last time you felt  I live a very happy recently I didn&#39;t for that I&#39;m getting married in a few months I got engaged on Labor Day 2012 this whole process Casino album a meeting some of them we&#39;d be kind of progressed very quickly realize where we would recognize her we were so I&#39;ve been a pretty happy state the past it&#39;s been 11 months now but yeah so I think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family I think those have been very happy times New Years was happy you know happy. Of my life right now so  yeah thank you  what sort of  sets of humor that maybe not everybody gets I&#39;d say also  you know helpful, I&#39;m relaxed Maybe  intelligent you know likes to recycle I know that&#39;s so suck that they would say  hey what else I think that best friend might say that I like animals I&#39;ve always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person I mean an animal person sees me I also you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans  I&#39;d say one of the most proud of in my life  well I&#39;m pretty happy with the level of Education I&#39;ve gotten I&#39;m also going back and starting the fall I&#39;m starting a Ph.D program so I&#39;m happy about that happy about you know breaking so my bad habits from the past that I&#39;d say if I&#39;m proud of anything it&#39;s that you don&#39;t have a strong faith relationship I go to church off and I&#39;m very happy about that I don&#39;t have pride is the right word but my relationship to my family and friends are all very good I&#39;d say maybe the fact that it&#39;s a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about 10 years ago you know that the change I&#39;m I&#39;m happy and proud of that  no problem have a good day thank you  goodbye  so

my childhood  the way I was raised  yes  18  to get away from home  are you happy  yes  no  okay  how easy was it for you to go back to civilian life  kind of hard  wandered around for a few years

I&#39;m starting to get more positive  tell me more about that  I&#39;m in recovery been in recovery for  19 months and  it&#39;s been a positive influence in my life  very easy  grouchy  not very nice  yes  how long is  about 2 years ago  I don&#39;t like crowds  loud noises are people being behind me  almost a general fear of people  when I don&#39;t know what their intentions are  maybe their actions or movements  maybe we sometimes what they say  can you tell me about that  growing up I started in gangs at about 13  and I seen a lot of bad things happen and since I didn&#39;t have a great childhood I was never home I was more in the street sent home so I&#39;m  I seen some things that kids shouldn&#39;t have been exposed to and therefore I got involved with some things kids should have been involved in  that&#39;s something I regret also  can&#39;t believe one peanut sauce  prayer  a lot of prayer  since I&#39;ve been in recovery  I found what some people call her higher power I believe in God  growing up I really didn&#39;t believe there was a god  not by what I experienced in when I went through  can&#39;t believe won&#39;t be in this honest with a character  it&#39;s brought me peace  piece of my life something I needed very much and I enjoy  I can&#39;t take it no more I was tired of being locked up going in and out of jails prisons  I&#39;ve been arrested so many times I lost count  the lifestyle that&#39;s why I meant about the lifestyle being in LA  it worried down if you don&#39;t die first so  I got tired of living that way  y&#39;alls becoming-animal at times and  you become less than a human being  it&#39;s no way to live life  it has its moments  yes everyday  except Saturday and Sunday  you feel better  all very useful  gives you away Tom  figure out your feelings your thought process  Channel your emotions it actually  how to teach you how to deal with your emotions and  can make you aware of what brings out certain emotions  sharp pain in certain anger issues  things that you weren&#39;t generally talk about  just like I&#39;m here talking to you right now normally I would never do something like this in fact I&#39;m, Mase I&#39;m doing right now  I generally don&#39;t trust people so here I am talking to a virtual person I know somebody on their side who I have no idea who you are and  before this would never happen I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t be as open as I am now cuz I honestly believe it&#39;s none of your business and anything I had to say you could only use against me but now I&#39;m running recovery have nothing to hide I&#39;m not proud of things I&#39;ve done  I&#39;ve learned to accept them because I can&#39;t change them  for the mistakes I&#39;ve made I&#39;m learning to be a better person  in some ways I think it&#39;s made me a better person and people who haven&#39;t been through what I&#39;ve been through because they have less compassion I can feel more empathy for others and compassion for others because of what I&#39;ve been through compared to someone who has it  I stay out of trouble  I&#39;m more trusting cuz right now this is really just is it really messing with my head seen her talking to you  this is really a trip I&#39;m peaceful I don&#39;t have my anger issues no more no hostilities no  no more dreams  last time I talked to my son  about a week ago  that brought me a lot of joy  fifth grade  so my counselors also some of the people that I&#39;ve been in therapy with all of us are  veterans Raikou therapy so a lot of us have been through some really traumatic events and  some of us are really overcome me some  deep issues in a positive way which is on  it&#39;s really  how my best friend describe me  my best friend hasn&#39;t seen me since I&#39;ve been in recovery so  he described me as being loyal  honest straight up  but I  volatile  wouldn&#39;t take nothing for nobody no Flack  but a good person to have on your side always loyal  get some for my roommate he&#39;s dying of a disease where his brain is deteriorating slowly he&#39;s only 30 years old and I&#39;m  he inspires me because he&#39;s got such courage everyday he&#39;s always in a good mood even though he&#39;s suffering from Life suffering you would never know so he inspires me so a Time song  I tend to feel like I&#39;m  I want to give him something back. He gives me so much everyday so sometimes I&#39;ll go out and I&#39;ll buy us a couple steaks or am I know he loves cheesecake it&#39;s all gone game cheesecake because at 30 years old to be suffering from the disease face suffering from where his brain is deteriorating slowly so he&#39;s losing all muscle control is starting to lose his eyesight this is like a slow killer which will progress and speed I guess as time goes on but he doesn&#39;t last long down and he&#39;s always good people now.  that inspires me to be a better person so I have nothing but respect and love for him so in turn  I try to do whatever I can for him  sometimes when our vets are trying to push him around us or white stand up for him cuz I don&#39;t believe now he&#39;s a little guy so I don&#39;t believe in no way push around other guys  thank you  Asiana accomplishing that you not really  that proud of you  I&#39;m working towards that but I  Aussie everything I&#39;ve done so far I feel like a  it&#39;s nothing really I should claim as being proud of you know even my changes I made it&#39;s just a part of all being a decent human being as far as  actually doing something that I feel like it clean and proud of  I haven&#39;t reached a plateau yet I hope to that one day  thanks it&#39;s been interesting  goodbye  like your outfit  stop the recording and you can take that number off of your shirt  and then the next step after this is

it seemed like the easiest thing to do  now now  I have a dream job for a while I was doing sports research for our Native American tribes but I enjoyed it but that&#39;s so it&#39;s not as  as often as it was mainly because of the the Sports Bureau that exist now that didn&#39;t exist when I started  Crystal when I do I still enjoy it  I&#39;ll be with it but I&#39;ll be with suits me in any given situation  you intend I turn on the fish tank screensaver hey I know it&#39;s not Hawaii but it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve got  what do you do  listen music  I like oldies Jazz soft music  I&#39;ve learned it well I have a question I was at Wayne but I&#39;ve learned to do it well  might want to bug you a super mean words but with my youngest daughter it was about a year-and-a-half ago  can you tell me about  where was stand over an incident I didn&#39;t like the way your husband said something to her and it bothered me and when I told her she got it extremely defensive and rather than deal with her when she became she became angry with me  I was mad  three girls 38-37 31  three granddaughters  11-14-18 so I haven&#39;t won an argument a long time but I adore all six of them  when I don&#39;t really consider myself a parent just wanna grow my baby&#39;s 31 and you never lose that but I&#39;m in my parenting at this point in my life I&#39;m enjoying my grandchildren when I was a parent that&#39;s a difficult job  getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand I don&#39;t understand and that putting your your stuff in front of theirs  hugs  well my dad was with physical and those days you know nobody called Child Services if you got hit  my mother was very loving you but my dad  I adored my mother my dad that was a hard guy but I love him  I never felt abused by him but I mean I&#39;m the one thing I remember you said when you when you&#39;re capable of kicking my ass you can leave this house  that&#39;s my hope that Skyler the bases of a relationship  okay  my mother  my kids my grandkids  I&#39;m one of them one of the three three sons really didn&#39;t have any experience with the females other than with my mother in terms of being the unrelated and my grandma and my first daughter was born I was like why was it so I&#39;m madly in love with her  change my life  that&#39;s what happened  when my mother got sick I wish I wasn&#39;t there for her the way she should have been  but I don&#39;t feel good  oh yeah you can always fix what you do with you  I was just in a real bad situation  but that doesn&#39;t excuse the fact that I wasn&#39;t there the way I should have been  at least I Did It My Way  why my second marriage probably she she wanted to have children already had my children with my first wife and I had told her initially that I did not want to have children that you know I&#39;m going to head 3 and I was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children  so we got married and then her best friend guy pregnant and our relationship changed and  I basically wouldn&#39;t relent and we had to get a divorce  I don&#39;t know what I would have had to it would have would have had children with her but I  I wasn&#39;t very flexible in the process  what to be flexible  sometimes I am sometimes or no  I&#39;ve been pulled my boy my father out of off of life support  what made you decide to do that I just keep going back to something he said to me when I was younger that he would come back and haunt me and if I do know if I let him Lay It lay there and suffer  took me a while to convince my other two brothers but that&#39;s what we do  can I get erased from my memory  being locked up for a while like erase it from my memory  it&#39;s an everyday hell where there&#39;s very little Humanity  and you got to do some things that you&#39;re not proud of  how easy is it  I&#39;ve never slept I&#39;m never slept a lot and I&#39;m one of those people that if I wake up I have a hard time going back to sleep so it&#39;s best if I&#39;m really tired than you know  what are you  I&#39;m pretty much so with the same oil change  socialite  things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the live incident with my granddaughter Midol youngest daughter but I had a friend recently who was runned over in a crosswalk and then he&#39;s on he&#39;s on life support Simon feeling too good about that it&#39;s it&#39;s affected me  was like he was jaywalking and he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the brakes o  and he&#39;s on that life support at this point  have you noticed any changes in your behavior or soccer  no not really because that&#39;s the thing about me is I&#39;m very inconsistent  no  no  but I&#39;ve had moments when I thought I was I was depressed okay I was talk to you when you were talking to any other question  yesterday  had a conversation with my 14 year old granddaughter  I&#39;m happy I have moments of Happiness everyday cuz I either speak to text with my daughters and granddaughters everything even if we&#39;re upset with one another  I have a lot of regrets  can you give me an  I should have went to law school  that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of something I thought you were going to think about more in my lifetime it was accepted I just didn&#39;t I had other other things I thought I wanted to do  I played with those wanting to be a kicker for football on the football team and had some tryouts things like that but didn&#39;t pan out  and that is as that didn&#39;t pan out I sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer  we just did other things  I&#39;ll take a big that was different I probably would listen to myself  by myself  I could be  if I don&#39;t like you I can be very very difficult if I don&#39;t like you  I&#39;d very much like to change that  it has in the past year  well I just threw that you can make me feel bad about myself only if I let you and I&#39;m not real big on letting people do that to me on my first wife when when she left me with the children she you know that it was my fault  and I wasn&#39;t sure that I believe that but I knew I was an ass and and so I probably believed it and not in its totality but in part  I&#39;m very I&#39;m not judgemental I will listen to anybody but that I agree with you or disagree with you  I&#39;ve taught myself to  control anger that I that I have  and if if I call you my friend or if I tell you I love you and I mean it that&#39;s that&#39;s not something that I do  casually  okay why I play 18 holes of golf with it with an old dear friend we got caught up and  4 hours on the golf course 2 hours at dinner  that is your wife have a good time  a lot a lot of memories came in  why am I not like my grandkids I like that you know I like the hell out of them  I don&#39;t have all kids in like that I think they&#39;re like too much on that rely too much on technology but  but that&#39;s me mainly cuz I don&#39;t  but if my grandkids are any any sampling of it I think they&#39;re good think they&#39;re pretty good  I raised my girls  basically by myself with the help of my mother  I think that&#39;s the thing I&#39;m most proud of  okay nice chatting with you  already  starting to run with the high school  good memory  head back over to the other
464 alright cool I&#39;m doing good what about you Los Angeles but I couldn&#39;t even recited Inglewood  we did I answer your question I don&#39;t know  okay  La the murals the ocean what else the people my family is over here so that&#39;s the best part  what about you  I would say the smog yeah the air had to be cleaner and yeah  that&#39;s what I mean is good people bad people too but yeah for the most part it&#39;s all good  yeah I&#39;ve been in Mexico and the temples and it was in California so yes  traveling like Tina are that&#39;s good healthy for the body cleaner blood flow the people culture and stories and then come back you share stories with like your friends  yeah anytime like right now or when  okay so I just one time I was a kid we went out to the temples and it started raining so we just start walking through in like when we get to the top one thing I didn&#39;t know before is that the higher you go does the smartest steps get so like people back then had on a smaller feet so what happened was as I went higher towards the temple I had to walk sideways so my feet can measure up to that the steps but once you get up there tonight to you  I am  general education but mainly art yeah I took a lot of art classes  well when I was a kid I scribble and walls with Crayola so I figured you know like it kind of stuck around with me so I just posted it so yeah  my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art  yeah  yeah pretty simple  it&#39;s not so much that it&#39;s hard it just requires passion persistence and faith and well you just have to really believe in yourself to yourself the more likely you are able to succeed  I consider myself to be shy and certain time of places but I am also outgoing when like I have the energy so I feel like it&#39;s well-balanced you know like I&#39;m shy when it&#39;s I guess okay to be shy you know and I&#39;m outgoing when like the need to actually have fun or just explore feels good like if I make sense but yeah  screensaver  yeah  2 hour relax  either well I&#39;m going to say this but I smoke weed so that helps and I like painting painting humans help me relax you know blue on relax me and also green when I use these two colors and make a painting account calms me down  I didn&#39;t have a blue shirt yeah  my temper well my thoughts and my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah scream until my temporary getting mad or if I do get mad what will be the outcome you know so control my temper is just like training my thought  the last time I argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because I wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready I was hungry eating you like nope so that kind of frustrated me and the way I handled it was like well I could just eat when I come back and I&#39;m doing him a favor so you know and then after you not to eat and eat in peace so yeah  my family is pretty good my mom and dad have a good relationship and still married and my brothers and sisters we help one another out so that&#39;s good it&#39;s just yeah it&#39;s a good team  a situation I wish I could handle differently would be  that&#39;s a good question I mean can I get scenario  okay  situation and kind of differently what you got something I feel like if I&#39;m calm in any situation I could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a Rubik&#39;s Cube maybe how to handle the situation would be just buy a feeling I&#39;m feeling making mistakes because I don&#39;t make the right mistakes and the right lessons will come after so that&#39;s the best way I could answer your question you know yeah  deposit influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence influence you know like yeah even though it may hurt like all the truth does hurt well they&#39;re not trying to be mean that actually  good influences I was in my friends my mom and dad my brother my sister&#39;s yeah  we&#39;ll see that&#39;s the thing like I have I&#39;ve had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day with that did was like give me more insight made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like dispense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kind like scar me a different pair me for like the world you know because it&#39;s happened to me when I was like 12 13 years old so if everyday could be exposed to like you know like guns nice and all that stuff so it&#39;s it&#39;s bad but it&#39;s good in a long-term you know because if you get out of that slump it&#39;s like nothing else would really phase you because you think you might have been through worse so it&#39;s not as bad as you know and  so yeah  the hardest  this one right now I don&#39;t feel like answering when I got stuck I like kind of think I was part of it but Hearts decision as far as like life-changing  life changing whether to continue school college or not I kind of chose  to like I went to school but I chose to pursue my own like  like I&#39;m there any more advice can I give myself with people who are already in the field I want to be in so that was a hard choice because there was no guarantee that I would like run into like the right people but I took that chance you know I&#39;m at the right people so  yeah  yeah yeah  how easy is it for you to get a good night  actually really easy I sometimes like I could sleep right now in like 10 minutes you know I just like like soda my air pattern  lately I&#39;ve been feeling good I&#39;ve been feeling like I have free will like at this point in time I feel like if I chose a path any path with like my heart I could get there you know but I&#39;m kind of like still deciding if I carry sing in August pass or in the air or should I make my own I don&#39;t know that&#39;s why I&#39;m at I feel like a free will  oh yeah  ladylike in the past 2 weeks or today  okay yeah you know like  yeah things happen that would change like my feelings and  example right now they just happened right now like  this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought because  yeah it&#39;s like it&#39;s technology you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s a trip to see how far I like one could take a thought and then make it reality so that&#39;s kind of like shifting my thoughts right now this experience this whole experience  yeah  post-traumatic stress disorder no  depression I know how it&#39;s like to be depressed but diagnosed by a doctor no  depression  how how it feels  how does depression feel like it feels like it&#39;s like a bird in the cage being depression is like being a fish who can&#39;t swim in the water have feeling depression is like being A Bird Without Wings pretty much it feels like you&#39;re limited but then a thing is to get out of that depression if I get to awaken and change your perspective and focus on  like I would say colors colors help and people talking to people helps  yeah  being depressed  16  I don&#39;t know like it could come like it to happen everyday like it&#39;s small doses doses so like I could say today you know earlier when I was just by myself I felt a little depressed then what happened I fixed it like a cut up a friend and met up with him and yeah  I mean at this moment I feel pretty happy you know I&#39;m talking to average person is pretty cool and yeah right now if you&#39;re happy  sometimes hard headed like you would try to teach me a certain investment whether it&#39;s art or just like in my character and yeah he just described me as like like like Listen by the same thing he&#39;ll still do what he wants to do but it&#39;s so pretty much like I don&#39;t know  yeah I mean that&#39;s what he tells me but your overall good person  I just exercised my diet food my food intake and yeah  health  I would say when I was like in middle school or in elementary little bit too but yeah it would be was it would either be about  will Pumas my heart like something and I thought it was good and then someone else be like all you know that looks kind of like like trash and then I&#39;ll be like oh damn I could accept and be like yeah it does kind of look and then fix it or why would do back then we&#39;ll be like damn you know you&#39;re going to do well and I thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually I&#39;ll come out of it but yeah you should use bone people&#39;s words  and ideas that yeah  yeah I said it  regret yeah I got a couple things I regret  like what well sometimes I feel like I should have completed the whole university thing but I mean at the same time I feel like if I really wanted to go I would have gone  so yeah that&#39;s kind of regret my head  10 or 20 years ago would be on seek spiritual well-being you know learn how to handle your thoughts to your thoughts I will teach myself pick the people you surround yourself with because that definitely has a major influence in your environment Street events you experience and as far as your overall happiness  yeah  among other things but yeah  I&#39;m most proud of right now is my paintings I&#39;m proud of that because like I feel like depends on releasing are things that no one else could duplicate you know it&#39;s like it&#39;s one of a kind of Nikes is there you know is Sazon signature something so yeah I&#39;m pretty happy about that  yeah thank you  are you thinking  alright bye  yeah
420 okay  thank you  and please  are you okay with  yes I am  oh my mocha  Chicago  back and forth over the years and traveled a little bit  haven&#39;t been out there over 15 16 years  kind of got stuck out here then I have my baby and I just ate  different food the people get along way I don&#39;t get it it&#39;s kind of a culture shock  tell me about  out there just on the food bases they like to give you a lot of food that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer but out here they want to go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lot of money so they just make it Mike  parent have business out here  not our got to get used to anymore  the views in the ocean  just splitting of people that&#39;s it  just a few places  what do you enjoy  getting in to see different people on learn how different people get along and interact with each other  I want to hear about your trip  I remember years ago where I went to Mexico with my brother  yeah  jumping into a lake pretty much off the side of a mountain  yeah  everything  it&#39;s not a subject I don&#39;t like  actually my dream job  working with computers and helping people  that&#39;s  where my heart is I like computers and also like helping people  sometimes when I&#39;m feeling 10 I turn on the fish tank screensaver  I meditate workout  I&#39;ll run I walk  alright read  in the median  I&#39;d say very good  oh yeah that doesn&#39;t make it seem that good last time I argued was over someone actually spitting out a racial slur or it&#39;s my wife  angry  upset her disrespected  and especially when I went up there that treat the person actually I was treating them with dignity and respect and trying to help the person the first  no problem people are people  how to Chance in school with a really go a lot further than I did  and I let something very small and meaningless stopped me in the pursuit of it  ignorance  for lack of a better word  now that I think back on it I could have done a whole lot to avoid it but I was just young and foolish  start loving again  much pain as I&#39;ve seen in the world  tell me about  a compilation of all the events are just different bad things that I&#39;ve seen  if I could change it I would but sometimes  I guess things are there for a reason even though we may not understand it  I have no answer to that  blood family really don&#39;t talk  my wife  don&#39;t know if she really wants to be there with me or not she thinks that I&#39;m doing everything in the world but that I&#39;m not really  I don&#39;t understand I know my daughter loves me but I don&#39;t know if she wants to be with me or not  because  when somebody talks to you  when I say something a certain amount of times in the tonnage in a voice and a belief in their eyes  if you say something so many times it would really lies in your heart so you can say whatever through your mouth but it&#39;s what really is there  I love my daughter  she&#39;s Angel I&#39;ll cut her umbilical cord went out there and put on her first shirt  I seen her come out  she looked at me right out the stomach she wouldn&#39;t she was fighting with the doctors wouldn&#39;t let him touch her a bit  I talked to her I told her to calm down I told her it was daddy she looked up at me grab my fingers and like just calm down and just let him do everything they needed to do  no it&#39;s constantly changing fast what you have to do on this day won&#39;t be the same thing as the next or the next after that it&#39;s constantly  what is a better word for  adjusting  the hardest thing I&#39;ll probably say  is  Spalding your child because you know you&#39;re doing it out of love for not learning the wrong lessons  seeing your baby smile and appreciation  I try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees  when I was younger there were a lot of things I seen that no child or adult should have seen and  I grew up  I swore to myself that always take care of my child and I wouldn&#39;t disappear  let her be around things like that  okay  my foster parents  can you tell me about  they basically showed me no matter where you come from  you can always strive to get better  okay  how easy is it for you to get a good night sleep  a good night sleep  it comes  the same just tired of yarn  have I been feeling  Ike  I have a wealth of queries and  a well that goal  within my grasp and it&#39;s just right out of my route because I just need that one  connector to really just  see what I&#39;m capable of and I know I&#39;m capable of a lot it&#39;s just  I need to make that connection  no  not PTSD no  I said yes but I don&#39;t figure on many more depressed or anything than any other person everyone has their different breaking points  okay  tell me about the last time you felt  my daughter&#39;s birthday on the 26th  can you tell me about  took her out to Chuck-E-Cheese she had fun she play games she was on bikes she was crawling through puzzle games man squad about everything  find loyal caring  what are some things you wish you could change about your  time to change  I would like to be more accurate  is there anything you regret  now getting to know who my mom was  what advice would you give yourself 10 or 20 years ago  stop thinking about whatever else happened to just do what you need to do  I&#39;m positive from goal oriented  determine  I&#39;m very imaginative very creative  ideal I will probably  be doing a little bit of everything rock climbing biking hiking going with my daughter places man  I&#39;ll probably be skiing snowboarding and everything and ideal weekend  my daughter  no problem  goodbye  I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t make sense you can tell by my shoes
334 Usher  if I have to  I can see I mean I don&#39;t know exactly her face but I can see that&#39;s a woman  okay  okay  yes  I got a little tired  Seattle Washington  oh and I was 18 my mom and dad decide we want to move to California and so we move down to Pasadena to Monrovia first and I&#39;ve been here ever since  yeah  I did about two years ago I went up for work and look around the area  pretty easy actually I do adapt  a warm weather not having rain tonight month of the year  people may lie  the the area how big it is a traffic  my first got here is a smog as better now  know when I was younger I was but I got out at work I did  sure why I became when I have my mom died and I need work I went for a job that was called petitioning and you have to go in front of stores and talk to people about signing petitions and you do that after awhile you don&#39;t get shy about talking to anybody also when I was in school I took public speaking and I learned that I really liked it more than I thought I would  so I so I did the census job I actually got four front of groups of people and talk to them and show them how to take the test and I enjoyed it  right now I&#39;m working on getting all my licenses for selling insurance  and I&#39;m going to start work out trying to get money from people to help kids and the and the world  all the one the job helping kids was also a paid job I need a paid job the one for insurance cuz I was getting older and I need work that was steady and that&#39;s something I can do it on 85 or 90 or whatever  to be an artist  I always been good with art I like drawing painting excetra but I didn&#39;t know if I could ever make a living out so I never really got into it and every time I tried it seems I never got anywhere so maybe when I get like 80 or 90 mail going to the Ceramics or something to do that as a profession  no unfortunately.  That&#39;s okay  I&#39;m not my mom and dad or die are dead I have no brothers or sisters and the rest of my family have either moved away or I don&#39;t talk to him anymore or like that  I&#39;ve have an attitude if I have me and friends I have and I&#39;m okay  I read  watch Parts when they&#39;re available  I say I used to play golf I may do that again someday but not right now because of the cost and the time  people that rude  are usually ignored this morning actually I told a guy to stop what he&#39;s doing and we got kind of an argument about and then the argument is over and it was done  very good because I had a very bad temper I was a kid and I told myself I had to control it  August morning about the guy making lots and lots of noise on purpose and in a place that was just not the place to do it I mean it was a public place but  and I was in just a little argument and I&#39;m done with the Army once I say what I say  yeah  not right now I can think of  oh I read  if I can travel I travel I don&#39;t travel long distances but even going out to Riverside is having adventure for me  seeing things on the way and back talk in the people maybe  well known for years ago I want rolled back he&#39;s to Massachusetts to do work back there on the way back I took a Greyhound bus all the way back from Washington DC see all the way back to California and the washing on 1st and I&#39;m down from there and work in Massachusetts for a bottle at 6 months to 8 Mile and joy the area quite a bit but don&#39;t want to be there when the snow came  and  enjoy coming back on the bus had people next to me almost all the way different people and a lot of fun  yeah  yeah I was in the Air Force and when I was 18 1965 during the Vietnam war  no I was in Great Falls Montana  and I really don&#39;t know yours later I probably learned more from the fact that I got out early and maybe I should have stayed in and stuck with it as younger and so now that and other things aside never quit anything  I came down here play pool for number years find a graduate from high school which I dropped out of when I moved went on the college got my bachelor&#39;s degree and an AA degree in Pasadena and Cal State LA and start working various jobs and that&#39;s about it took care of my mom  a business was my major I also studied things like anthropology and philosophy and history excetera  no  no never do  lately not so good between the fact I sleep in my car and it&#39;s very cold and that sometimes I do get and with all the things going on in my life right now as I think of things can solve and plus I get up at 4:30 in the morning  that&#39;s okay  I tired  and I got a little grumpy sometimes but not very much  tired with all the things I&#39;ve had to do and the weather and the sleep  no  a little bit sometimes about how maybe I should start doing all this years ago  I just go on I tell myself to basically stop it and go on doing what things to improve myself  not very anymore took me years to study dad to do that  I don&#39;t know if you called Xander not bud  a couple months ago and I passed all my tests and Medicare Advantage  passed every one of them for every come in and send them to me  I expect everything I do now on persistent  I don&#39;t let things get out of hand before I do something about it  I used to be what&#39;s the word I put off things I don&#39;t do that anymore  hand  I treat people nicely always until given a reason not to  and I don&#39;t talk about my bad stuff to anybody usually  not very because the same thing I&#39;ve trained myself over the years that not talk about myself I talk to other people talk about them  how I said my mother  Gabby  Bertrand Russell  I&#39;m not sure who else other people I&#39;ve had that I don&#39;t remember their names or they were teachers excetera  early in life I like I said I stopping everything not completing things that I regret very much  oh yeah I could have done better  probably device I gave myself to get off my butt and go learn get an education and get all of my life and do something  dog survive  tell me about  well I&#39;m 65  I&#39;ve been sleeping in my car for a number of years I went from sleeping on pavement or I got a car lot done that improve my credit rating I&#39;ve got a number of jobs I&#39;ve been very happy with I have had a lot of friends both all people that are homeless and on Alma&#39;s  Handa  have a pretty good health  how are the other people in my family have died young  so I guess that&#39;s about it  good jokes  people having a happy time  going to having a drink with somebody on occasional basis  how about eight months ago was last time when I had a beer with someone  I say  probably  can I wasn&#39;t one foot of a live wild deer  I was in a green Lake and Washington  and I was out behind your house and that&#39;s wild buck deer was walking in the field and I started motion into it and came of them out one foot of me

441 yes I&#39;m doing fine thank you  Los Angeles California  the variety of people  the Multicultural food  and  going to movie  real people scary people  violent  I&#39;m sure you can tell by my shoes I&#39;m not much of a world Explorer  you travel a lot yes  experiencing different things in different cultures  well I was stationed in Germany for three years it was a great experience  food was great averion Alps the snow the people I loved it  having a baby  well it was this the most memorable thing in my life something I never forget  great  once I&#39;m grown handsome father-of-two  no it&#39;s actually very hard for me  not becoming angry too quickly  being able to cultivate a mind and love someone unconditionally  well I went through a lot of trauma as a child so as a parent I was very afraid for my child to go to that thing, try to protect him from it  I think it&#39;s really hard because you never really know people and what they&#39;ll do  outgoing  because if I&#39;m in a room with people I&#39;m usually  the first one to start talking  doesn&#39;t matter fact I have fish aquarium that&#39;s what keeps me calm  not very good  seems like everyday argue with somebody about something but yesterday  I&#39;m a lady tried to cut line in the grocery store and I politely told her I was in line and she didn&#39;t want to move  yes it have because sometimes if people don&#39;t want to move then I feel it&#39;s my place to move them  hurting people physically  if I feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me I can get very ugly I don&#39;t like that about  I was pulled over by the police and they had someone with my name and they were very rude to me and I really wasn&#39;t happy with the way they treated me  how to stay calm when someone has  crossed over into my boundary  my personal space  I can&#39;t let people get too close to me if they do I eyelash out I don&#39;t want anybody in my area of  protection I guess  stay away from people  stay away from him it&#39;s hard you can&#39;t live in this world without other people sometimes I just irritate the heck out of me  being assaulted in the military something I wish I could forget  just that I felt helpless alone ashamed and angry  that&#39;s about all I want to go into it  18  very young  no  because I was assaulted in and I have a fear of  people in uniform like policemen hurting me or other military veterans hurting me when they  explode or go off or have issues of  PTSD  I can&#39;t remember  what did you do after the military  I work for the federal government  well just seemed like a normal progression the federal government gives you 10 point preference over other people for being in the military still being like a Natural Choice organization that had a book of rules and they follow them the government what government to another  are you happy  yes  well it was hard in the sense that in the military you&#39;re giving you told to handle it handle it and in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and different people to talk to to get something done  administration of justice  no I&#39;m I don&#39;t work anymore  oh yeah  almost 2 years  the feeling that I was always going to be hurt that someone was out to get me I had nightmares panic attacks anxiety attacks out  outbursts of anger  I was always an emotional pain  and I always wanted to hit somebody  yes mostly disrespect what I feel is disrespect of people getting too close to me or I feel in fear of them for some reason  I can&#39;t remember the last time I had a good night sleep  what  irritable angry Moody pissed off  irrational  tired  sick of the world angry at the world  wanting to be left alone  sometimes I don&#39;t want to go on  yes  oh yeah oh yeah  well I I could recognize the trigger now when something is going to trigger me I can at least  no and act accordingly if I want to  when I found my grandchildren when they came to visit  I just so innocent and sweet and precious it was just a joy to have them around 8 make me forget about all the pain in life  planting seeds for some vegetables making a garden  I read somewhere that it&#39;s calming and soothing to work with your hands and dirt so I decided to find out  plant something and watch it grow  sitting on the beach look facing the water  thinking talking to God  wishing I was somewhere else  Kauai  Penthouse / Maui  that I could trust people  that I wouldn&#39;t lash out at them  I could sleep at night  crazy  hot headed  emotional  being in the wrong place at the wrong time  don&#39;t trust anyone be careful be wary of people and what they want from you  I said I grandchildren  I don&#39;t have a real family I don&#39;t I haven&#39;t seen my brothers in like 20-30 years I only have two brothers and I don&#39;t haven&#39;t seen them my mother&#39;s family I haven&#39;t seen in years my father&#39;s family haven&#39;t seen in years my parents are dead and my son lives in another state  wow  some of the older people that I give care to  sometimes I&#39;m a caregiver so sometimes the people that I work with older and wiser  I&#39;m loyal  spiritual  supportive kind generous  bite
355 yes  alright  I was born in Los Angeles California  I want the weather and  the fact that the people aren&#39;t so obtrusive like on the East Coast  just the the traffic in the Smoky weather  I used to I&#39;m unemployed now so I&#39;m rarely go anywhere  I have a BS in business with a computer option  I thought that the only place I can get a job with a business degree was in accounting or in business computer message so I took that I took business computer math adoption  I probably be  professional sports player and actor something something that you enjoy doing  I like to ride my bike I like to watch sporting events now I can&#39;t afford to go to them so I pretty much watch on TV  I like to travel but like I said I don&#39;t have money for that anymore  that&#39;s all right  people who are chicken heads they getting their nose in other people&#39;s business even if they&#39;re just strangers expect that from a family member  where are friend but you know fishing with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what Orwell is referring to when he spoke the big brother in 1984  I don&#39;t do much him much different than I would otherwise  and I had many temper outbursts  girl you was my aunt  and it was because she was basically  making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and if you don&#39;t know I&#39;d me greatly  I&#39;m kind of on the outs with my parents  the black sheep  I mean my Mom&#39;s done the most to help me she&#39;s done a lot you know more than anybody by far  well I mean she&#39;s just me one time when I was in like 15 I went with a friend of mine to see the Crosby Stills Nash and Young concert at the Forum and she has seven kids and she pick me up at the Sizzler is right across the street from the Forum at 11 at night and I couldn&#39;t imagine the others had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did  oh probably  going down to the cape at the end of a Baja Peninsula and Cabo San Lucas or photograph in the bridal veil falls in Yosemite  I was by the two most majestic see sites I&#39;ve ever seen  it was when I could afford to travel  no  no  I was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in April of 2011 and I took some Lexapro but I stopped after one day I didn&#39;t want to do it anymore  no  because I didn&#39;t feel it was help I feel I was becoming a zombie  yeah  depressed about not having a job for over two years I lost my job in October 2010 and except for you nose job like this which I&#39;m fortunate to get just neon daily things focus groups like that I haven&#39;t worked  thank you  Ashley when you&#39;re 56 years old  well just get the general feeling of hopelessness  I get out of my bicycle out of walkthrough bikes 4 hours a day spent about 2 hours each  yeah it&#39;s good to me  very easy  cuz now I&#39;m old when I was young I couldn&#39;t sleep more than 4 6 hours a night  cuz I&#39;m Restless  are you triggered by something no  but now that I&#39;m old I am I sleep much more easily  I pray before I go to sleep and that that&#39;s it that&#39;s when I can&#39;t have any trouble sleeping I just pray beside different prayers like the Lord&#39;s prayer Hail Mary stuff like that and I&#39;m leaving to fall off to sleep  I don&#39;t know probably  you have any news Civic remembrances  I love that you know it was when I had money to spend I know that and when I had to have a job to have money to spend so it&#39;s probably 15 years ago  well  I haven&#39;t really enjoyed anything that last week I did a made $75 on that job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and the enlisted people to play  the basically the relatives of people who&#39;d been in this fall bombing at the Staple Center and we you know ask question sign up unit on giving information on missing you no relatives and basically I was provided by the county and they said they went to a routine in downtown LA  that&#39;s not hard it was just a just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give this ethics of their characteristics height weight excetera  I don&#39;t have a best friend  I&#39;m a very bright I&#39;m a perfectionist at my job  I bet about it  I got a business degree and I&#39;m never been a motivated person I went to school I went to  2 state colleges in two junior colleges to need that in so I believe that was probably the most significant contribution that I made to my  anatomiya I guess self-esteem you might say I had something to hang on the wall  yeah I regret you know alienating family members  I would have  basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs think thinking that you know I can always get another one and not you know basically blow-off jobs I could probably work at one of the employers that I used to work for now  Fade Out and locations but I burn Bridges there so that&#39;s not possible  thank you  hasta luego
